Homeownership is becoming an impossibility in the U.S. with rising costs and demand through increased immigration.

Housing demand must be curbed with responsible immigration limits.

Please work with your colleagues to secure our border and decrease illegal and legal immigration.

Sincerely,

[Greg Raven](https://www.gregraven.org/), Apple Valley, CA

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
