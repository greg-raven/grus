I am writing today to express my opposition to CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation.

This regulation proposes unrealistic emissions standards for locomotives in California, which could lead to numerous adverse consequences affecting public well-being and the economy. Implementation of CARB's regulation will result in job losses across the country, disruptions in the supply chain, and potentially higher harmful emissions if freight shifts from rail to trucks. Moreover, it will halt crucial rail facility projects, such as the Barstow International Gateway, that will play a significant role in reducing highway congestion and generating thousands of well-paying jobs in Southern California.

I urge you to do everything in your power to stop CARB's harmful locomotive regulation from moving forward. We need more support for common-sense regulations that accelerate the commercial viability of lower- and "zero-emission" locomotives while protecting California jobs and our nation's supply chain.
