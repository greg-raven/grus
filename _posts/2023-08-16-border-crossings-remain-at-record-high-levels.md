I am disappointed that recent media reports and statements from Biden administration officials indicate that the historic border crisis is beginning to wind down.

While the number of illegal border crossings has lessened, migrants showing up at ports of entry along the Southwest border in June hit its highest level since Resident Biden took office in 2021, without even counting the number of migrants who were paroled into this country by the Biden administration at a port of entry NOT along the Southwest border.

According to Customs and Border Patrol, the Office of Field Operations (OFO) encountered 110,958 migrants at ports of entry along the Southwest border in June. That's the highest level of OFO encounters with migrants at the Southwest border in history. In June of 2021, Pres. Biden's first year in office, OFO encountered just 28,927 migrants at ports of entry.

The Biden administration has also established a number of different routes for would-be illegal border crossers that don't involve crossing the border illegally.

In sum, roughly the same number of migrants are entering the country each month.

I urge you to support parole and asylum abuse reforms and cosponsor the E-Verify bill S. 156, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act.
