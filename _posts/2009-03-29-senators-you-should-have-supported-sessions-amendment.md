Sen. Sessions’ amendment to the omnibus would have protected millions of American jobs, yet you would not even support giving it a straight vote. How appalling!

There are more than 12 million unemployed Americans. This means that more than 8% of Americans who want a job are unable to find one. I would like to think this statistic breaks your heart, but your vote against Sen. Sessions’ E-Verify amendment suggests otherwise --- as do your previous votes against E-Verify and for amnesty.

I know I should not be surprised with your vote. You have consistently voted in favor of amnesty and against bills that would help American workers. However, I am not one to give up easily.

You must realize that the your constituents, not to mention the American people, support programs like E-Verify and oppose amnesty and programs that give preference to illegal alien workers. Why do you insist on opposing the will of your constituents?

I urge you to look deep inside yourself and determine if you can continue to harm America’s unemployed and underemployed. Americans are suffering because you refuse to help them. Be brave and take stand for America’s less fortunate.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
