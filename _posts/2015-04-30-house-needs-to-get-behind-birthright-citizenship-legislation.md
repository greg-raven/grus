Passing the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2015 is key to stopping the flow of illegal aliens across our borders. While the United States continues to grant citizenship to the children of illegal aliens, illegal aliens will still have an incentive to risk their lives in an attempt to come to this country illegally. I urge you, for the sake of all involved, to cosponsor H.R. 140, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2015.

President Obama has made the problem of birthright citizenship worse than it already was. Indeed, it is the basis of his amnesty program. Because the president says it would be unfair to deport illegal aliens with U.S.-born children, he is intent on giving legal status and work permits to illegal aliens. If those illegal aliens were not given citizenship in the first place, the president wouldn't have a leg to stand on.

President Obama's decision to amnesty illegal aliens with U.S.-born children is encouraging more people to come to this country illegally and overstay their visas, safe in the knowledge that President Obama will not allow them to be deported. This abuse of the law cannot be tolerated. Please cosponsor H.R. 140, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2015, and help to get the bill passed.
