I am writing to express my support for your Assembly Bill 1092, which seeks to enhance the rights of responsible firearm owners throughout the Golden State. This legislation recognizes the importance of not just the right to own a firearm, but the right to carry it securely and responsibly.

Currently, California law mandates that individuals seeking a concealed carry license must fulfill specific criteria, including completing a designated training course and not being classified as a disqualified person. Under these stringent regulations, licenses are valid for just two years. However, AB 1092 proposes to extend the validity of these licenses to a full four years, a significant improvement that acknowledges the commitment and responsibility of California's law-abiding gun owners.

This change is not merely administrative; it reflects a growing recognition that responsible individuals who have proven their competence and character should not be burdened by unnecessarily frequent renewals. After all, fans of the Second Amendment understand that our freedoms come with responsibilities and that training and accountability are key components of responsible firearm ownership.

By extending the duration of concealed carry licenses, AB 1092 promotes a more effective and practical approach to firearm laws while reinforcing the rights bestowed upon us by the Constitution. With this bill, California is taking a positive step toward respecting the rights of its citizens to defend themselves and their families effectively.

We once again than you for introducing AB 1092 --- a bill that not only aims to simplify the process for responsible gun owners but also advances the cause of liberty in California. Together, we can ensure that our rights, our safety, and our freedoms are protected for generations to come!

Thank you for your dedication to this important issue.
