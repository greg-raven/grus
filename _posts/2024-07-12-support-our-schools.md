Our border crisis is resulting in an unprecedented number of migrant children "adding financial and logistical strains in communities," according to the recent *Wall Street Journal* article titled "The Massive Immigration Wave Hitting America's Classrooms."

I am upset about how the mismanagement at the border is harming the quality of education for our children.

It is disappointing that provisions in H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, have not yet become law.

Please contact me to discuss how E-Verify and asylum and parole abuse reforms can rescue our schools.
