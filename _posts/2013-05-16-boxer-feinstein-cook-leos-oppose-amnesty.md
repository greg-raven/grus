A group of law enforcement agents from around the country have written to you, warning you of the public safety dangers in the Gang of Eight's amnesty bill. I hope you will read their letter and oppose the bill.

Currently, law enforcement officials are hamstrung by their inability to enforce the law. The letter addresses this:

"S. 744 also does not address current failures of interior enforcement that will render any legislation ineffective, regardless of its provisions. Currently, ICE officers cannot arrest or remove most illegal immigrants they come in contact with, even if officers believe those individuals present a risk to public safety. To avoid offending special interests, ICE officers are also prohibited from making street arrests, and are also prohibited from arresting illegal immigrants who are public charges or who violate laws involving fraudulent documents. ICE officers are under orders to wait until immigration violators commit and are convicted of criminal offenses and placed in jail by state authorities before they can act in their capacity as Federal immigration officers and make an arrest. Even though illegal entry and visa overstay violations account for the majority of the 11 million illegal immigrants currently residing in the United States, DHS and ICE have directed ICE officers not to enforce the laws related to these offenses."

I am just as disappointed as the law enforcement officials with the government's refusal to enforce immigration laws. Please read the entire letter and oppose this bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
