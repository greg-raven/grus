Thank you for your recent executive order holding federal agencies accountable for H-1B abuses in the contractor sector. I'm sure you were as shocked as I was to learn of the TVA's plans to outsource crucial IT jobs in one of the nation's critical infrastructure grids --- especially during the dire jobs situation facing the nation.

Your memorandum goes a long way to protect America's federal employees from losing their jobs to senseless outsourcing. I look forward to seeing what further H-1B reforms your administration will take to preserve and extoll the American workforce. Thank you for continuing to follow through with your America First campaign promise.
