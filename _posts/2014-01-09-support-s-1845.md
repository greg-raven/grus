Supporting the Sessions amendment to S. 1845, the unemployment benefits extension bill, is the most important action Congress can take to provide relief to jobless Americans. I hope you will support it.  
  
The purpose of the unemployment extension legislation is to help Americans who cannot find jobs. Currently, more than 20 million Americans cannot find a full-time job. In addition to requiring employers to run new hires through the Chamber of Commerce-approved E-Verify system, mandating it’s use would gently move illegal aliens out of U.S. jobs. Over time, the 7 million illegal aliens in non-agricultural jobs would be replaced by unemployed Americans and legal workers.

I hope you will support Sen. Sessions’ amendment to the S. 1845. Doing so will result in fewer Americans being unemployed, which should be every American’s goal.

P.S. Unlike healthcare.gov, E-Verify is in place and is working. We should be using it!
