Immigration-driven population growth like the migrant crisis can exacerbate the effects of extreme weather events, with the stakes (e.g., tax dollars, property, and lives) getting higher every year.

For example: The urban heat island effect, where the sprawl of asphalt, concrete, buildings required to support a growing population --- plus waste heat from motor vehicles --- increases the ambient temperatures in growing cities. 41 million people live in a census tract with an urban heat index of 8 degrees Fahrenheit or higher.

Attach The Secure the Border Act to the continuing resolution or send the bill on its own to President Biden to sign.

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
