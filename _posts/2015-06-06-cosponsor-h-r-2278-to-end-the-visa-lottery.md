The visa lottery no longer meets the needs of U.S. immigration policy and harms the job prospects of unemployed Americans. With this in mind we hope you will cosponsor the bipartisan H.R. 2278, which would end this program.

Americans continue to struggle to find a full-time job, so I can’t understand why we continuing to raffle off 55,000 permanent work permits each year?

Not only do these lottery work permits cost taxpayers money, they also cost Americans jobs. These individuals are let into the United States without regard to their talents or skills (or lack thereof) and are able to compete against unemployed Americans for U.S. jobs. Doesn’t this seem just a little bit unjust to you?

I urge you to cosponsor H.R. 2278 and help to end this needless waste of taxpayer’s dollars and giving away of U.S. jobs.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
