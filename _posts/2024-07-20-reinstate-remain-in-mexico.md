Biden's Proclamation on Securing the Border allows an average of 2,500 illegal immigration encounters per day. And that doesn't count minors or any inadmissible alien who uses the Border Patrol app. That is deplorable.

The floor for illegal immigration into the U.S. should be zero, *not* 2,500 a day.

I want to discuss with you realistic ways to stop our border crisis by ending all asylum application abuse and reinstating Remain in Mexico policies.

Sincerely,
