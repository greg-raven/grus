Please do not allow the federal government to house illegal aliens in our state. The Obama administration is responsible for the influx at the border and should not be forcing our state to deal with the consequences.

Instead of securing the borders and enforcing our immigration laws, President Obama is doing the opposite: he is letting tens of thousands of illegal aliens come across our borders with impunity. Not only does this harm our nation, it creates a human rights disaster for the illegal aliens the government is housing.

Please make sure the government doesn't try to house illegal aliens in our state. The Obama administration needs to secure the border and stop illegal immigration, not welcome illegal aliens with open arms.

P.S. As long as the government is willing to move them, let's make certain that they move them back across the border!
