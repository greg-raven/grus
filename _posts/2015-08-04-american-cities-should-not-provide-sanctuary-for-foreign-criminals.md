The recent shooting death by an illegal alien who had been previously deported from the U.S. five times, highlights the federal government's refusal to enforce our country's existing immigration laws. Please end the existence of so-called "sanctuary cities" by supporting S.1842 that would require cities and states to cooperate with federal immigration agents.

The Obama Administration's recent decision to end the Secure Communities program that allowed federal immigration agents to detain illegal aliens held in state and local jails is only part of the problem. More than 200 cities refuse to cooperate with federal immigration agents, and the Obama Administration has done nothing to prevent them from doing so.

But Congress shares the blame as well. For years, bills have been introduced to end "sanctuary cities", but lawmakers have done nothing. I urge you to prevent future tragedies committed by criminal illegal aliens and support S.1842, introduced by Sens. Jeff Sessions and Ron Johnson, that would end "sanctuary jurisdictions" once and for all!
