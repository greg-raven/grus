As a construction worker, it disappoints me that construction employment is nearly 2 million below is previous peak. There’s a lot of hiring to be done and a lot of unemployed Americans willing to work in the industry if Congress passes legislation to get things moving. However, passing any amnesty or immigration reform will only make things worse for all American workers.  
  
I simply cannot understand why people continue to say there’s a “labor shortage.” This simply isn’t the case! No industry in America has a labor shortage. In the construction industry, there are 1.9 million fewer jobs than there were in April 2006. If we’re short of anything, it’s jobs.

I urge you to support legislation to put Americans back to work. However, please oppose efforts to keep Americans out of work, such as comprehensive immigration reform. Bills such as this will only bring in millions of foreign workers when we don’t need them and millions of Americans will wind up unemployed.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
