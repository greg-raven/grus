8 U.S.C. 1401 currently says that "a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth." Clearly, the Constitution does not need to be changed in order to prevent the children of illegal economic migrants, tourists, and temporary foreign workers from receiving birthright citizenship; a simple piece of legislation will do.

The United States is almost the only industrialized nation to still practice automatic birthright citizenship to the children of tourists and inadmissible aliens. I hope you will support sensible reforms to limit the practice for children who have at least one parent who is a citizen or a legal permanent resident. Doing so will help at the U.S. - Mexico border as illegal economic migrants will have one less reason to come, stay, and work in the United States.

Please co-sponsor H.R. 569, the Birthright Citizenship Act, today!
