According to a new DHS report, nearly half a million foreign visitors overstayed their visas in FY2015. On seven separate occasions, Congress has provided funding for the yet-to-be-completed biometric entry-exit system. It's about time you follow up on your actions and make sure DHS finally implements this system at all ports of entry. Every nonimmigrant visa that the United States issues contains a departure date by which foreign visitors must leave the country. But all too often, this date is ignored, and there is no system in place to identify and locate foreign visitors who overstay their visas. An automated entry-and-exit screening system for foreign visitors was passed by Congress in the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act signed by President Bill Clinton in 1996. Since then, Congress has approved funding on seven different occasions, but three presidents, Pres. Clinton, Bush, and Obama have failed to implement the system. It's not an exaggeration to say that had a biometric entry-exit system been in place in 2001, the 9/11 attacks could have been prevented. I urge you to begin taking our national security and the integrity of our immigration system seriously by doing all you can to ensure implementation of a biometric entry-exit system at all ports of entry.
