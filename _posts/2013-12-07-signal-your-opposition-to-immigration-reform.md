Republican pro-amnesty Representatives are circulating a letter urging the House Republican leadership to support comprehensive immigration. I urge you not to sign this letter. Signing this letter will give President Obama a hope because comprehensive immigration reform is one of his biggest policy goals and would include and amnesty for illegal aliens.  
  
In addition to the falsehood that immigration legislation needs to be “comprehensive,” it is almost certain that such a bill would include amnesty for illegal aliens; this is what President Obama is pushing for and this is included in the bill that Reps. Denham and Valadao have cosponsored. Signing this letter and supporting its intent would give President Obama a success. Surely it cannot be prudent for Republicans to support one of the president’s top policy objectives when the elections are less than a year away.

I hope you will not sign this letter. Passing amnesty and comprehensive immigration reform would be bad for the American people and would not help you win votes.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
