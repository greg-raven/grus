I urge you to vote NO on the motion to bring to proceed with S.744, the Gang of Eight's immigration bill. This legislation is so bad and so unfair to the American people that it simply does not deserve debate; it deserves to be put down. The Senate needs to go back to the drawing board and create legislation that serves the interests of the American people.

In the first decade after its passage, 33 million new foreign workers will receive work permits. This is at a time when 20 million Americans can't find a full-time job. How is this just? How is this fair? Doesn't the Senate have a duty to protect American workers and all those Americans of working age who would like a job but have given up looking for one? Or, is it the Senate's duty bring in tens of millions of new foreign workers to disenfranchise even more American workers?

Yes, more immigrant workers will build America's GDP. However, more immigrant workers will decrease GDP per capita. Yes, there will be more, but it will not go as far. Those who benefit the most will be the businesses who want to use the less-expensive, green card labor.

This is not the future our nation needs. Our nation does not need 33 million more workers in the next ten years. Please oppose the bill on Tuesday.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. No more lies! Secure the border. Evict the illegals already here. Evict the "anchor babies" and their families. Prosecute any remaining illegals under the RICO act. Return to the rule of law!
