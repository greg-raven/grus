Chairman Intelâ€™s comment makes clear how little the tech industry values the American worker. You have a responsibility to protect us from people like him.

MSNBC has quoted Craig Barrett of Intel as saying:

> "We should just staple a green card to every advanced degree granted to a foreign national from a U.S. university in science and engineering."

This is what the advocates of raising H-1B caps are fighting for. The Senate must stop taking its lead from leaders like this in the tech industry who --- unlike Senators --- have no need to be loyal to the American people.

Unless Senators begin to realize how radical and anti-American these statements are, you are going to make immigration decisions that will eventually lead to your removal from Congress by the voters you are supposed to represent.

Sincerely,
