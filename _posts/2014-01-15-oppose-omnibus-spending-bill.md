Please oppose the 1,500-page, trillion-dollar, sequester-scrapping secret spending bill that is coming up for a vote. We sent you to Washington because you promised fiscal responsibility and accountability. Spending ever-more on an ever-increasing Federal government provides neither.

How about we cut $2.4 trillion out of the budget for starters, and then start looking for other ways to reduce government?
