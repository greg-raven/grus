It is ridiculous that Sen. Harry Reid and Rep. Zoe Lofgren have introduced legislation that would require the government to use tax dollars to provide UACs with lawyers. Individuals who came to this country illegally should not receive any more handouts and you should not support this legislation.

The surge of unaccompanied illegal alien minors at the border hasn’t dropped or even leveled off — it has increased. A new DHS report says that the number of UACs arriving in the first 4 months of FY2016 has doubled compared with the same time last year. The government doesn’t need to spend more money on attorneys for illegal aliens, it needs to spend more money on fencing and Border Patrol agents.

This legislation is simply a ploy to amnesty illegal aliens and a handout to immigration lawyers. I urge you to oppose this legislation and make sure our borders are protected.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
