Your misplaced "compassion" contributes to the border crisis. We need competency. As the worst border crisis in over 20 years continues, the Biden administration has announced new curbs on enforcement in the interior and the workplace, and Democrats in Congress are working on their third attempt to include rewards for illegal immigration in the budget reconciliation bill.

Your deeply-flawed border strategy has failed. Nearly 2 million border apprehensions have taken place in Fiscal Year 2021, including 1.6 million since Resident Biden took office. More than 70,000 people have been released at the overwhelmed border since August alone. People are losing faith in the head resident, in the Democratic Congress, and in the immigration system itself.

We need oversight from Congress, which should not be offering new incentives for illegal immigration in the reconciliation bill or anywhere else.

P.S. Mass immigration is a weapon of mass destruction.
