I hope you will follow House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy's lead by coming out against trading a "pathway to citizenship" or a DACA amnesty for border security. Rep. McCarthy said:

> "I believe Biden has destroyed our border so badly. You can't tie the two. You've got to just go fix the border to start out before you can deal with immigration. I just think it's too far broken. I don't think anyone's going to believe you if you tie the two together."

The Biden administration has created the current border crisis and Congressional Republicans shouldn't give him an illegal alien amnesty to fix it. Moreover, trading amnesty for increased border security will only encourage more people to come to the U.S. illegally.

Your top priority should be passing legislation to close asylum loopholes, to improve border infrastructure, and to mandate use of the E-Verify system.

P.S. Secure our borders now and evict all illegals currently in the country, including DACA law-breakers.
