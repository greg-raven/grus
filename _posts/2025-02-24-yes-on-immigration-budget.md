H. Con. Res. 14, the House's budget resolution, provides for an additional $200 billion for President Trump's immigration and border enforcement priorities.  Specifically, the budget allocates funding for border security improvements, additional CBP and ICE agents, additional immigration judges, and additional detention beds.  The budget also provides for funding for states and localities who wish to help the government enforce immigration laws.

Please vote YES on the House's budget resolution to move President Trump's immigration and budget priorities closer to the goal line.
