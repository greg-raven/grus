I am glad that the Republican Party's immigration platform closely matched many of President-elect Trump's immigration enforcement pledges. I urge you to work with the incoming president to make these pledges into law.

I was pleased that the GOP is taking the lead on protecting our nation and protecting American workers. I was pleased to read in the Republican platform that:

"America's immigration policy must serve the national interest of the United States, and the interests of American workers must be protected over the claims of foreign nationals seeking the same jobs. ...

"Our highest priority, therefore, must be to secure our borders and all ports of entry and to enforce our immigration laws."

These positions mirror President-elect Trump's immigration enforcement pledges that he announced during his August immigration policy speech. If these policies are followed through on, the United States will be a safer, more just, and more prosperous nation. Use of the E-Verify system must be mandated so that individuals who come to the country illegally cannot take jobs from Americans, and legal immigration should be restricted to nuclear family members and extraordinarily skilled workers.

I hope you and your fellow Republicans will use the 115th Congress to turn President-elect Trump's immigration pledges and the Republican Party's immigration platform into law.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Just like Bill Clinton promised in his 1995 State of the Union address.
