I trust that you will do everything in your power to strengthen our nation's borders, but am concerned that your dedication to crafting a comprehensive immigration bill stops short there.

You said if a compromise is to win House approval, "it needs to be about border security first," and hinted that you might accept legalization of illegal aliens if tighter border restrictions prove successful.

That sure sounds like you're in favor of pushing an amnesty through with this bill, and I respectfully urge you not to punish millions of American citizens and workers by rewarding millions illegal alien lawbreakers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We need you to be part of the solution, not part of the problem!
