A handful of bipartisan U.S. Senators have introduced S. 4787 to give green cards to more than 100,000 Afghan evacuees who don't qualify for refugee status or special immigrant visas. I oppose this legislation!

The Biden Administration abused its executive parole powers by admitting Afghan evacuees without proper vetting. The Department of Defense Inspector General found that most of these paroled evacuees were not vetted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence's National Counterterrorism Center, posing a risk to national security and public safety.

S. 4787 would give these unvetted Afghan evacuees green cards even though they don't qualify for refugee status or a special immigrant visa program already created by Congress for Afghan evacuees.

Please oppose S. 4787, which would essentially "rubber stamp" the Biden Administration's abuse of executive parole.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
