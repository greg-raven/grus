Please do all you can to encourage the Biden administration to secure the border and enforce the law to end the border crisis.

The ongoing crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border will not end unless you and your colleagues take steps to force the Biden administration to secure the border. As shown by USCBP data, the crisis is getting worse by the month; the most recent numbers show that the agency encountered more than 370,000 illegal aliens nationwide in December (an all-time high) and nearly 250,000 in January and more than 250,000 in February (both are record highs for their respective months)! It's clear that the Biden administration's current policies and priorities are driving the crisis and encouraging illegal immigration.

You and your Congressional colleagues must force Resident Biden and his administration to secure the border and stop rewarding illegal economic migrants with work permits and far-off notices to appear. The crisis will not end until this administration's priorities change and it starts to put Americans and legal immigrants ahead of illegal aliens; please do all you can to force the administration to change its border crisis-exacerbating policies.
