I strongly urge you to vote no on H.R. 5717.

I stand with the [Firearms Policy Coalition](https://www.firearmspolicy.org/) against this outright assault on our fundamental rights.

HR 5717 is an encyclopedia of measures that have been experimented with in states with only one result: FEWER rights for people like me and MORE attacks on our Constitution.

Every single line of this bill would deprive me of my natural rights.

I will NOT stand for it and I urge you to vote NO on H.R. 5717!

Sincerely,

[Greg Raven](https://www.gregraven.org/), Apple Valley, CA
