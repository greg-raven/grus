Biden fell far short of conservation goals. Reducing immigration is the way forward.

When he took office, Resident Biden pledged to put in place polices that would lead to the conservation of "30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030." Unfortunately, his administration's promises to save America's beleaguered wildlife were more than offset by Biden's immigration policies.

Our high level of immigration drives America's population growth and our biodiversity crisis. As America becomes more densely populated, our nation's natural areas are in decline and threatened with development, along with land and housing prices rapidly rising. The U.S. now has a population of 341 million, the third most populous country in the world. As we continue, adding a new resident every 17 seconds, it is becoming more difficult to conserve natural lands.

America's reckless immigration policies are sabotaging our efforts to preserve biodiversity. The U.S. Census projects that America's population will soar by another 35 million by the Year 2060, with 90% due to immigration. This jump in numbers will lead to many critical habitat areas being bulldozed by urban sprawl and resource extraction. Please fight for biodiversity by working to reduce America's unsustainable immigration rate.
