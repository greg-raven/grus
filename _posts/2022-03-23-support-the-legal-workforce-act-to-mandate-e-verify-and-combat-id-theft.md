Please cosponsor H.R. 78 to mandate E-Verify.

The Legal Workforce Act would not only require employers to run new hires through the free and easy-to-use E-Verify system, but it also notifies employers when a suspected stolen or fraudulent Social Security Number has been stolen or is being used. Once this happens, the employers are required to run the employee in question through the E-Verify system to help weed out illegal alien workers.

Simply put, this bill is an easy and cheap way of putting millions of Americans back to work. Please help combat ID theft and the hiring of illegal aliens by cosponsoring, H.R. 78, the Legal Workforce Act.
