It is ridiculous for anyone to propose legislation that would bring more foreign workers into the United States when millions of American STEM workers can't find jobs. Your Startup Act 2.0 is such a piece of ridiculous legislation.

Why on earth do you think U.S. businesses need more foreign workers to hire? Data from the U.S. Census Bureau show that there are a total of 1.8 million U.S.-born individuals with engineering degrees who are either unemployed, out of the labor market, or not working as engineers. How will 125,000 more STEM graduates in the labor market help these Americans find work? Clearly they won't.

No, it's clear that you just want to help your millionaire and billionaire friends in the business sector to hire more foreign workers, who cost less to hire and employ than American workers. Your support of corporate America is very noble and patriotic and will be remembered when you come up for reelection.

I hope you will reconsider your support for this legislation. If you don't, it certainly won't be forgotten.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
