Our state's two Senators need to take a page out of your book when it comes to passing an enforcement-only immigration bill. Please speak with them.

The Senate has shown how out of touch it is with the American public and its constituents, by considering a series of bills that focus not on enforcement, but on increasing the numbers of green cards and H-1B visas. It seems the House is working for the people and the Senate is working for its corporate campaign contributors.

Not only will the Senate bill exacerbate illegal immigration by rewarding 10-20 million illegal aliens a series of amnesties, but it would double legal immigration, effectively chartering a course toward a U.S. population of 500 million (half a billion!) people by mid-century.

I hope you understand how important it is that you do everything in your power to convince our Senators to join you in passing sensible immigration reform.

A country that cannot control its borders is not really a country. A country that cannot control its population is doomed to fail.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
