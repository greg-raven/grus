8 U.S.C. 1401 currently says that "a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth." Clearly, the Constitution does not need to be changed in order to prevent the children of illegal economic migrants from receiving birthright citizenship; a simple piece of legislation will do.

The United States is almost the only industrialized nation to still practice birthright citizenship. I expect you to help America get with the times by supporting legislation that would change our nation's laws and prevent the children of illegal economic migrants from receiving birthright citizenship. Doing so will help to end the crisis at the U.S. - Mexico border as illegal economic migrants will have one less reason to come, stay, and work in the United States.
