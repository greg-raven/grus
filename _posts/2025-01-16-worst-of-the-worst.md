Not surprisingly, you have been utterly true to form at the confirmation hearings. Not only have you fit right in with the other disgusting Democrats, you have presented yourself as the perfect example of what is meant when people say they love this country but hate the government. As always, you did not represent me, my friends, the state of California, or the United States. At the risk of feeding your ego, let me say that you are among the worst of the worst.
