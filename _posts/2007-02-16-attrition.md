It may be unrealistic to deport all illegal aliens, but that does not mean we should provide them with amnesty. You should consult with Rep. Steve King about his Attrition Through Enforcement solution.

We know Attrition Through Enforcement will work because, until recently, it has been shown to work even with little or no enforcement by the Federal government. 

As it currently stands, almost 200,000 illegal aliens self-deport from the United States every year, but imagine how many more would leave if our government refused to award illegal aliens another amnesty, mandated all employers to verify a person’s eligibility to work here, cracked down on identity fraud, and enabled local police to easily transfer illegal aliens in their custody to the feds. 

Rep. King' s excellent *Washington Times* column outlines Attrition Through Enforcement very well. I encourage you to take a look at it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
