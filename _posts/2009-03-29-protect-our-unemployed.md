Amnesty is not the answer to America's illegal immigration debacle and would only make matters worse. Please do not support any amnesty proposed by the Congressional Hispanic Caucus.

February 2009 numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics indicate that more than 2.6 million Hispanic Americans are unemployed (this number includes nearly 1.7 million Hispanic American men). This means that more than 12% of Hispanic Americans are unemployed and looking for a job. However, 7.7 million illegal aliens have a job. Doesn't this seem a bit unfair?

However, it is likely that the Congressional Hispanic Caucus will advocate comprehensive amnesty when you meet with them. It seems that the Hispanic Caucus has the interests of illegal aliens, not Hispanic Americans, at heart.

Please do not support any amnesty plans when you meet with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. We both know that an amnesty would harms tens of millions of Americans of all races.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. At least twice, you have taken an oath to protect the United States from foreign invasion by other illegal aliens. Do your duty!
