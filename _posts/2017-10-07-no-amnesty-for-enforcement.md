I expect you to oppose the SUCCEED Act any effort to trade amnesty for immigration enforcement --- it's simply not enough and won't stop illegal immigration!

If such a deal happens, illegal aliens will still be able to hold U.S. jobs. Moreover, border security, alone, does nothing to stop visa overstayers --- who account for 40% of the illegal alien population --- from staying and taking jobs. Mandating E-Verify would go a long way to solving this problem by preventing illegal aliens from obtaining jobs in the U.S. --- the primary magnet for illegal immigration.

Before any discussion of amnesty, Congress also needs to end chain migration. A new study by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that each illegal alien who receives an amnesty would sponsor, on average, 3.45 family members for green cards.

I urge you to oppose any attempt to give legal status or green cards to illegal aliens!

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Reagan fell for this once. There's no need to repeat this mistake.
