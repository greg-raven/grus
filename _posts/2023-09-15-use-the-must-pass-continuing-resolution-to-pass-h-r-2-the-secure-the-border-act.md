The must-pass Continuing Resolution is a great opportunity to pass H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. This legislation, if passed, would help to end the crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border. This legislation would:

- plug the loopholes in our asylum system that are exploited by illegal economic migrants, restoring its integrity and protecting it for legitimate asylum seekers;
- block the government from continuing its policies of catch-and-release, thus deterring future waves of illegal migrants;
- put a stop to the surges of family units and unaccompanied alien children, protecting them from exploitation and victimization by the cartels and traffickers;
- put teeth into efforts to deter visa overstays;
- rein in the breathtaking and illegal abuse of parole; and
- institute mandatory nationwide E-Verify, which would shut off the "jobs magnet" for illegal immigration while protecting jobs for American workers.

As you can see, H.R. 2 is an incredibly important piece of legislation that would help to end the crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border. Please get H.R. 2 passed by attaching it to the Continuing Resolution!
