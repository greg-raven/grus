Ding Dong! The Witch is dead. Which old Witch? The Wicked Witch!  
Ding Dong! The Wicked Witch is dead.  
Wake up — sleepy head, rub your eyes, get out of bed.  
Wake up, the Wicked Witch is dead. He’s gone where the goblins go,  
Below — below — below. Yo-ho, let’s open up and sing and ring the bells out.  
Ding Dong’ the merry-oh, sing it high, sing it low.  
Let them know  
The Wicked Witch is dead!
