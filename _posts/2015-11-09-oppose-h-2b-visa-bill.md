I hope you will oppose H.R. 3918, legislation to increase H-2B worker numbers. This legislation excludes returning H-2B workers from the annual cap and needs to be opposed.

By exempting returning H-2B workers from the annual cap, H.R. 3318 increases the number of H-2B workers by nearly 200,000. This would irreparably harm young Americans with only a high school diploma. The U-6 unemployment rate for young Americans with just a high school diploma is 23.5%. The number is far worse for African American and Hispanic Americans without a high school diploma: young African Americans without a diploma have a 46.7% unemployment rate and Hispanics a 33% unemployment rate.

The increase in H-2B visas would mostly harm these young Americans without higher education. Instead of allowing businesses to hire less expensive foreign workers, please oppose H.R. 3918 and force businesses to hire unemployed Americans.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven

P.S. I know you are concerned about jobs. We need to give what jobs are available to U.S. citizens, not to foreigners.
