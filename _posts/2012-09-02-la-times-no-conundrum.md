Mr. Bennett,

The title of your article, "[Immigration Conundrum](https://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-deport-parents-20120902,0,2092705.story)," is misleading. There is no conundrum, and the law is clear. There is no law in the United States that we have birthright citizenship. Therefore, any children born here of illegal aliens is not a citizen, and thus must be expelled from the country along with the illegal alien parents.
