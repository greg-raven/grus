I recently read *The New York Times* article (12/9/22), titled "Animals are running out of places to live," which described the massive loss of biodiversity and habitat for a huge number of species, which includes 1,300 struggling for survival in America. Although I'm happy that President Biden issued an executive order to protect 30% of the country's lands by 2030, how can wildlife habitat be preserved while immigration into our country is accelerating fast?

Even if the Democratic Party were to meet the goal of protecting 30% of America's wildlands, how will these lands remain wild against a backdrop of exploding population growth and dwindling natural resources? These designated wilderness areas will face insurmountable pressure in terms of agriculture, resource extraction, and urban sprawl.

To reduce population pressures on our wildlife and wilderness areas, please support immigration legislation (e.g., limiting "chain migration") that would lower America's rapid population growth and help to save our country's biodiversity.
