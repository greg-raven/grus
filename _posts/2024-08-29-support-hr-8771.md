I ask you to please oppose the United Nations' so-called "Arms Trade Treaty."

Also, please support Section 7048(1) of H.R. 8771, which prevents the president from implementing the elements of the UN Global Gun Grab Treaty even without it officially being ratified.

From beginning to end, the ATT requires nations to adopt universal gun registration, bans on common guns and concealed carry, and even bans on private gun sales. This treaty, which really amounts to a Global Gun Grab Treaty, must never be ratified or enacted in any part.

I and many thousands of gun owners in your state are watching what you do.
