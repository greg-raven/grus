Please vote to confirm Senator Jeff Sessions as attorney general. The new administration has a lot of work ahead of it repairing the damage done to our country and to the rule of law by the previous administration, and Senator Sessions can play a key role in that effort.

For more than two decades, Senator Sessions has been the Senate’s leading voice in favor of immigration policies that serve the national interest and are in line with the recommendations of the bipartisan U.S. Commission for Immigration Reform, chaired by the civil rights icon Barbara Jordan. Senator Sessions is one of the few in Congress to speak up for the working women and men whose incomes and very jobs have been threatened by the desire of special interests for increased cheap foreign labor.

As the nation’s chief law enforcement officer, Senator Sessions would uphold the U.S. Constitution and the rule of law by pursuing local jurisdictions that protect illegal workers from federal immigration agents and encouraging the enforcement of immigration laws passed by Congress.
