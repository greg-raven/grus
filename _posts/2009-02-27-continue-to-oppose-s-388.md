There are millions of teenagers who would like to work summer jobs, but Sen. Mikulski’s bill, S. 388, would prevent hundreds of thousands of American youngsters from finding jobs. I know you cosponsored a similar bill during the 110th congress, but have so far refrained from cosponsoring this bill. Please do not cosponsor this bill or any other bill that would harm American workers.

I find this proposal to be absolutely appalling. S. 388 would at least triple the H-2B worker cap for the next three years, allowing businesses to import up to 300,000 additional less-educated foreign workers. There are more than 1.6 million young Americans (ages 18-29) with a high school degree who are looking for a job but cannot find one. It is clear that you are aware that this bill would harm these less-fortunate Americans.

While you have supported similar bills in the past, I urge you to continue to oppose this proposal. S. 388 is a horrible bill that would keep hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work. Please do all you can to ensure that this bill does not make it through the U.S. Senate.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
