The Swift raids are a good start, but one day of raids will not solve the immigration crisis. We need constant pressure put on illegal aliens and their employers.

While politicians continue to promote unnecessary and unwanted guestworker-amnesty schemes, Americans across the country are witnessing the power of Attrition Through Enforcement. Local ordinances and arrests in the workplace have opened up jobs for hardworking Americans. The Swift raids were immediately followed by long lines of Americans applying for a job. 

Workplace enforcement is a critical part of Attrition Through Enforcement. I hope the 110th Congress will insist through oversight that the Bush Administration do far more of this, opening up jobs to the 25 million less-educated Americans who are not currently in the workforce --- and going after people who threaten us with their identity fraud.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
