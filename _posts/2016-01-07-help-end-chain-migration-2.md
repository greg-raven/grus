Rep. Jody Hice’s Nuclear Family Priority Act, H.R. 604, is a fantastic bill that will help solve America’s immigration problems. Please cosponsor it!

Ending chain migration was one of the top recommendations of the Jordan Commission on Immigration Reform. The commission concluded that chain migration serves no compelling national interest while harming the Americans who most need our help.

While ending chain migration would directly reduce overall immigration by around 1.2 million a decade, it would eventually and indirectly lead to an even larger decline in other categories. The creation of the chain migration categories has been the primary reason total authorized immigration has skyrocketed from 2.5 million per decade to 10 million.

Please cosponsor H.R. 604, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, and help solve America’s immigration mess.
