California is running out of money, cut benefits to illegal aliens!

I was shocked and appalled to see Governor Newsom say that cutting taxpayer-funded benefits to illegal aliens was "not on his docket" in the face of a $30Billion budget shortfall and an insolvent Cal-Med program.

Rewarding illegal aliens with billions in taxpayer-funded public benefits reinforces the wrong message from the Golden State, not to mention making California an even larger magnet for illegal immigration. It is a step in the opposite direction of where our state must go!

California Assembly Minority Leader Gallagher could not have said it better, "The state is shelling out $9.5 billion on healthcare for illegal immigrants while emergency rooms overflow, hospitals teeter on the brink, and working Californians struggle to see a doctor. Rather than making responsible choices, leaders are raiding the rainy-day fund to keep the spending spree going. This isn't just a budget crisis --- it's a complete failure of leadership."

Please do all you can to review and restrict the residency requirements for California public benefits! Our State depends on you doing so! And that doesn't just include healthcare but employment, tuition, and so much more.
