I hope you will cosponsor H.R. 29, Rep. Chip Royâ€™s Border Safety and Security Act. The Biden administration refuses to do what is required to end the crisis at the border and H.R. 29 would force his Department of Homeland Security to end the flow of illegal aliens across the border. Specifically, this bill would:

- grant authority to DHS to suspend the entry of illegal aliens in order to achieve operational control of the border;
- require DHS to suspend the entry of illegal aliens for any period when DHS is unable to either 1) detain illegal aliens who have a credible fear of persecution pending their asylum hearing, as required by existing law, or 2) return such aliens to the country they entered from pending their hearing; and
- allow states and localities to sue the administration when DHS fails to suspend the entry of illegal aliens when required.

Please help end the border crisis by cosponsoring H.R. 29, the Border Safety and Security Act!

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. Make E-Verify mandatory.
