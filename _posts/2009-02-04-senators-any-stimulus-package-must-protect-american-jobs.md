I saw an advertisement on CNN which states that America imports 1.5 million foreign workers each year. Why would we allow this to continue at a time when more than 11 million Americans are out of work?

I find it truly appalling that the United States Senate is considering passing an economic stimulus package that has no protections for American workers! How can the elected representatives of the American people have such a wanton disregard for the welfare of America's less fortunate?

You must take immediate and decisive action to ensure that businesses which benefit from any economic stimulus package are required to hire American workers. American taxpayers are funding this stimulus package and we should be the beneficiaries of it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
