Reps. Tom McClintock and Mario Diaz-Balart have introduced H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. This legislation, if passed, would help to end the crisis at the U.S. --- Mexico border. This legislation would:

- plug the loopholes in our asylum system that are exploited by illegal economic migrants, restoring its integrity and protecting it for legitimate asylum seekers;

- block the government from continuing its policies of catch-and-release, thus deterring future waves of illegal migrants;

- put a stop to the surges of family units and unaccompanied alien children, protecting them from exploitation and victimization by the cartels and traffickers;

- put teeth into efforts to deter visa overstays;

- rein in the breathtaking and illegal abuse of parole; and

- institute mandatory nationwide E-Verify, which would shut off the "jobs magnet" for illegal immigration while protecting jobs for American workers.

As you can see, H.R. 2 is an incredibly important piece of legislation that would help to end the crisis at the U.S. --- Mexico border. Please support it and do all you can to get it passed and signed into law.
