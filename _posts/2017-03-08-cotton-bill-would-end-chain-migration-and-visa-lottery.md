Sen. Cotton is introducing legislation, the Reforming American Immigration for Strong Employment (RAISE) Act, that would end chain migration and the visa lottery. Most immigrants who come through these two categories are lower-skilled and compete for jobs with America's most vulnerable workers. Please support American workers and their wages by cosponsoring this bill.

Sen. Cotton's bill is the first Senate legislation since 1996 to target chain migration and is long overdue. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by civil rights leader Barbara Jordan, recommended that immigration must be reduced to serve the national interest. Specifically, the commission recommended that chain migration be eliminated so that less-educated and lower-skilled Americans would have a fair chance of finding work and a decent wage.

Only 1 out of every 15 foreign workers are on a skills-based visa, meaning that our nation is not bringing in the best and brightest, but instead admitting millions of foreign workers without special skills to compete against unemployed, less-educated Americans. This is one of the main reasons that tens of millions of Americans have left the workforce. Sen. Cotton's legislation would also end the visa lottery, which hands out 50,000 visas at random without any regard to an applicant's skills.

Please cosponsor this legislation and work to secure its passage. Immigration needs to serve the national interest, not harm American workers.
