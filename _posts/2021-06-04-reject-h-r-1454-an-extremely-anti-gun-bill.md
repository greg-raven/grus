I am writing to you today to reject H.R. 1454, which would classify firearm parts as guns in the eyes of the law.

This draconian bill is a blatant attack on our Constitutional right to build and assemble our own defensive implements at home. What's more, H.R. 1454 would amount to a backdoor gun registry, which we all know is a prelude to confiscation.

H.R. 1454 violates the Second Amendment and should therefore be *rejected* by the Congress. I respectfully urge your **no** vote on this legislation.
