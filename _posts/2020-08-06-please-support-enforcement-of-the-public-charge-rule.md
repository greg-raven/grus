I was saddened to hear that New York District Judge George Daniels halted the Trump Administration's Public Charge rule, again, even after the Supreme Court struck down an identical nationwide injunction put in place by Daniels in January.

Public charge exclusions are among the first and most consistent immigration laws enacted by Congress. That is because one of the backbones of our nation's immigration policy has always been that migrants should be productive members of society, and not dependent upon nor beholden to the public fisc to survive. This policy makes good sense, especially given the strain already placed on America's welfare programs.

Now, Congressional action may be the only way to ensure that the Public Charge rule is implemented and enforced. Please support legislation that puts disadvantaged Americans first, and support the Administration's expanded public charge rule.
