During your campaign, opponents claimed that you would get us into World War III. I not only scoffed at the idea, and pointed out your many statements about disengaging the U.S. from the role of world policeman, but reminded them that the horrible foreign policy track records of the Clintons and our past presidents argued for "business as usual" should you not be elected.

Sadly, your current actions have made me wrong and your naysayers correct.

First, I realize that the unfounded charges of collusion with the Russians during the last election cycle have somewhat tied your hands, but you absolutely must leave that to the side and find common ground with Putin. Russia is far less a threat than China, and could be a powerful partner in addressing many of the geo-political issues facing the world. Unfortunately, rather than seizing the opportunity to create this common ground, you have instead brought us to the brink of a shooting war with Russia, over issues that concern us not in the least. I urge you to abandon your current course and seek rapport with Putin and Russia.

Second, you campaigned on the promise of disentangling the U.S. from the endless squabbles in the Middle East. Instead, we seem more enmeshed than ever. From Syria to Afghanistan to Saudi Arabia to Yemen and beyond, you seem to have adopted the failed policies and actions of your predecessors. I urge you to abandon your current course, get our troops out of the Middle East, and stop meddling in the affairs of other countries.

Third, you hinted that maybe the U.S. would pull out of the United Nations and NATO. Instead, you seem intent on making certain that these failed institutions are fully funded, with increased reach and scope. George Washington in his farewell address said, "It is our true policy to steer clear of permanent alliance with any portion of the foreign world." Thomas Jefferson's policy was, "Peace, commerce, and honest friendship with all nations --- entangling alliances with none." Nothing good ever comes from such alliances even when they are fresh, and both the U.N. and NATO are stale remnants of failed policies of the past, which carry within them the seeds of future world-wide catastrophes. I urge you to get the U.S. out of the U.N. and NATO, end other military-political alliances, and refuse to enter into such alliances in the future.

It is vital to the survival of our country that Donald Trump the President act as Donald Trump the candidate promised he would.
