Americans want to cut immigration. The polls show this. Any immigration bill coming out of the House has to make deep cuts in immigration numbers next year and 10 years from now."

In the short-run and in the longer run. Overall numbers have to go down. Visas can't be cut in one category and then added to other categories. Polling shows we voters want deep cuts by 3-to-1 margins.

Please do all you can to reduce immigration numbers!
