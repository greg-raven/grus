Earlier this week during his State of the Union address, Resident Obama said, "The defining issue of our time is how to keep that \[American\] promise alive."

What he conveniently omitted from his speech was that his failed policies have done nothing to make it easier to achieve, or afford, success. In fact, as the table below shows, the Obama Administration has left Americans worse off.
