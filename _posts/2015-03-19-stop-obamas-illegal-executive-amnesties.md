I am very pleased that U.S. District Court Judge Andrew Hanen has decided that President Obama cannot, for the moment, follow through on his plans to break the law by unilaterally granting amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. I hope Congress will use this opportunity to bring immigration policy back to Congress by passing legislation stopping the president's actions.

The very fact that Judge Hanen has found that the 26 states' have standing on this issue means the legality of the president's executive amnesty is seriously in doubt. This should simply serve to reinforce that Congress, and not the executive, has precedence over immigration policy. President Obama has acted unilaterally on this issue and taken steps he said time and again he didn't have the legal authority to take.

I hope this judicial decision will spur you and your colleagues to take the initiative and pass meaningful immigration legislation, including mandatory E-Verify, but most importantly, legislation that would stop the president's actions.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
