Former Democratic Texas congresswoman and civil rights champion Barbara Jordan chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform under President Bill Clinton.

Under Jordan, the Commission envisioned an immigration system that would invest in American workers while reducing chain migration and still being welcoming to newcomers.

Employers bypass domestic workers for alternatives who are deemed more efficient for their business models. But society is still left with the abandoned workers. An immigration policy that spurs investment in American workers is going to be beneficial for the nation. That is what Barbara Jordan was fighting for during her final act of patriotic service to her country. She was defeated in her quest only by her untimely death. America would be a different place today had she lived and prevailed.

Please work with your colleagues to fulfill the Jordan Commission recommendations of investing in American workers and talent, ending chain migration and reducing immigration numbers.

Sincerely,
