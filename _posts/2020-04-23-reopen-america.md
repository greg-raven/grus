Due to the Coronavirus, our economy has been effectively shut down for weeks now, and it’s having a MASSIVE impact on millions of Americans like me. While we should do everything we can to stop the spread of this deadly virus, we can’t let that goal create a crippling economic disaster, the likes of which we haven’t seen since the Great Depression.

As your supporter and as a proud FreedomWorks activist, I’m urging you to keep up the fight to safely reopen our economy.

In just a matter of weeks, our country has gone from having the lowest unemployment rate in decades to the single-largest jump in job losses in American history. Over 22 MILLION people have lost their jobs. And if we don’t start opening our economy soon, it could be YEARS before those jobs return, if they return at all.

Public health and safety depend on more than dedicated doctors and nurses. They depend on an economy that allows people like me to provide for their families and support their friends and communities. If our economy collapses and takes YEARS to recover, countless Americans will be MORE vulnerable to viruses like COVID-19.

Please, President Trump, I urge you to think about the countless Americans in our country, struggling to provide for their families. I urge you to reject the Fake News Media and keep up the fight to reopen America.
