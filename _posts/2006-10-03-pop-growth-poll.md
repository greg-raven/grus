Two-thirds of Americans want immigration reduced in order to slow population growth, according to recent polls.

As the immigration debate has suffered from a lack of discussion about one of the central issues: immigration's influence on population growth. 

The Census Bureau projects that, if current immigration rates are allowed to continue, the country will add well over 100 million additional residents by mid-century, with most of the growth caused by immigration. This poll asked likely American voters from different regions, ethnicities, economic brackets, and political affiliations if they thought this growth would have a positive or negative impact on their quality of life. The majority of voters from all walks of life agreed that this growth would have a negative impact. 

Sixty-four percent of voters said the country needs to reduce immigration numbers: Democrats (59%), Independents (59%), Republican (74%), Asian (64%), Black (72%), Hispanic (57%), White (65%), Professional workers (56%), White Collar (65%), Blue Collar (74%), Part-Time (62%), Not Working (68%), Retired (69%). 

Nevertheless, Republican leaders such as Senators McCain, Brownback, and Frist; most Democratic Senators; and the Republican White House favor immigration INCREASES! The Senate went so far as to approve a bill (S. 2611) that would DOUBLE immigration numbers --- a policy that is supported by only three percent of likely voters: Democrats (2%), Independents (4%), Republican (2%), Asian (7%), Black (1%), Hispanic (5%), White (3%), Professional Workers (4%), White Collar (1%), Blue Collar (3%), Part-Time (3%), Not Working (1%), Retired (2%). 

This disconnect cannot last forever. Eventually, these American voters will elect people who share their concerns.

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction. Secure our borders now!
