Representative Jerry Lewis

A new poll conducted by Pulse Opinion Research shows that an astounding 94% of Republican voters support mandatory workplace verification. With numbers like these, there is absolutely no reason for the House not to pass a mandatory E-Verify bill and help America's unemployed get back to work.

The results of the poll are clear: American voters support E-Verify. To be specific:

- 78% of all likely voters support mandatory workplace verification;
- 94% of Republican voters support mandatory workplace verification;
- 84% of independent voters support mandatory workplace verification;
- 92% of very conservative voters (of all parties) support mandatory workplace verification;
- 85% of somewhat conservative voters (of all parties) support mandatory workplace verification; and
- 88% of moderate voters (of all parties) support mandatory workplace verification.

After looking at these poll numbers, how could any Republican Member of Congress not support legislation mandating use of the E-Verify system? Requiring employers to use E-Verify would put unemployed Americans where they belong: at the front of the hiring line.

I hope you will support legislation to mandate use of the E-Verify system and will press the House leadership to hold a vote on the legislation.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
