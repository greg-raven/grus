I was appalled to learn that Reps. Paul Ryan, Mick Mulvaney, and Mario Diaz-Balart are about to do an informal whip count on moving immigration legislation. If this goes well, it is expected that the House Republican leadership will join their skulduggery and hold an official whip count and hopefully hold "comprehensive amnesty votes" before August. I cannot understand why these Representatives would go behind the backs of their Republican colleagues and do something that, in the long rung, would harm all Americans.

With 18 million Americans unable to find a full-time job, and tens of millions more Americans having left the workforce in despair, I cannot understand why any Republican Representative would actively work to pass legislation that gives work permits to 11-18 million illegal aliens and doubles legal immigration numbers. How will Americans ever get back to work if the legislation backed by Reps. Mulvaney, Ryan, and Diaz-Balartz passes?

Any immigration legislation passed by the House would give Harry Reid the House-passed immigration legislation he needs to force the Obama/Schumer amnesty on the American people. Please make sure the Mulvaney/Ryan/Diaz-Balart plan doesn't get off the ground. Please tell the House Republican leadership that it doesn't have your support.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
