It is absolutely appalling that so many Americans (13.2 million as of March) are unemployed. Luckily, Vice President Biden’s recent comments in Costa Rica make it clear that now is the wrong time to support any sort of mass amnesty.

More than 13.2 million Americans are unemployed. This means that 8.5% of all Americans who want a job are unable to find one. This is the highest unemployment has been since 1983! With this in mind how could you or anyone in the Congress support a bill to legalize millions of illegal aliens?

Millions of American families are hurting because one or both of the family’s breadwinners are unemployed and unable to pay the mortgage or put food on the table. Doesn’t this fact sadden you greatly?

Why, then, are you proposing a mass legalization (amnesty ) of illegal aliens? You must realize (as Vice President Biden does) that this would only harm America’s unemployed and underemployed.

Please do not support any “comprehensive immigration reform!” Such a proposal, if enacted by the Congress and signed by you, would irrevocably harm tens of millions of Americans.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. And this at a time when 138,000 More foreign workers received work permits!
