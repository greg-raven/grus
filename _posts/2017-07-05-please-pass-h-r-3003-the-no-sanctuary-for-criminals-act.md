I urge you to support the recently passed House bill, H.R. 3003 that would end sanctuary cities, if it reaches the Senate floor for a vote.

This legislation would simply require state and local police to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts. It is a myth that this bill would force our state and local police to enforce federal immigration laws against their will, and it is a myth that sanctuary policies improve trust between the police and the communities they serve. There is simply no evidence to support that claim.

If a jurisdiction in our state refuses to cooperate with federal immigration enforcement efforts, certain federal grants could be put at risk. Is it really worth risking public safety to protect individuals that have violated our immigration laws? I donâ€™t think so.

I urge you to do the right thing by supporting H.R. 3003 should it reach the Senate floor for a vote.
