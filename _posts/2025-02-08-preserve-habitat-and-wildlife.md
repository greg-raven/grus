America is having a "biodiversity crisis." According to the U.S. EPA, our country has over 1,300 endangered or threatened species. Habitat loss is the primary reason our wildlife is being driven to extinction, and America's high population growth is driving habitat loss.

We cannot stop America's decline in wildlife while immigration (legal and illegal) adds roughly 3.5 million people every year.

Reduce America's immigration rates.
