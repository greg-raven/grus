Please oppose outrageous increases to the corrupt EB-5 program.

Even according to The New York Times, the EB-5 program is known to be highly corrupt, yet a group of wealthy real estate developers “spent as much as $3 million to help defeat legislation co-sponsored by \[Senator\] Grassley and Senator Patrick J. Leahy, Democrat of Vermont, intended to address fraud and national security concerns.”

The May 8, 2017 editorial by The Washington Post is correct: “ending EB-5 should be a no-brainer.”

Do not allow any increases in the EB-5 program to slip into a coronavirus package or anywhere else.
