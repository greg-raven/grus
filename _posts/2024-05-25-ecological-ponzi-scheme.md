When I heard that Sir David Attenborough just turned 98 years old, I felt inspired to write to you. As one of the most influential naturalists of our time, it's no wonder that Attenborough has advocated for restoring biodiversity, and voluntarily limiting human population growth. He also believes "indefinite growth can go on forever in a finite world [or country] is either a madman or an economist."

In America, historically high rates of legal immigration are now being eclipsed by illegal immigration, with about 2.5 million illegal border crossers and visa overstayers per year. Given its role in driving almost all U.S. population growth, overall immigration must be significantly reduced to achieve a sustainable population. Please work to pass immigration-reduction legislation (e.g., limiting chain migration, securing our border).

Stop the relentless, unsustainable plunder of nature.
