Please heed the strong warning about David Chipman from a past ATF head.

Did you know that even former ATF Director Michael Sullivan thinks that David Chipman should be disqualified for leading the bureau?

In an OpEd published on Fox News, Sullivan wrote:

> "His partisan advocacy is his right as a private citizen, but engaging in his specific advocacy means his ability to objectively carry out the constitutional and legal responsibilities of the ATF, and effectively lead the more than 5,000 men and women who serve there, will be questioned both within and outside of ATF."

Mr. Sullivan also wrote:

> "Moreover, it has been reported that he mocked those who recently became new gun owners and advocated for the forceful closure of fully legal gun stores during the early days of the pandemic, despite their classification as ‘essential’ under the Department of Homeland Security’s Essential Industries list."

Mr. Sullivan concluded by writing:

> "Policy debates around firearms should be left to the lawmakers in Congress, not to agency leaders. If a nominee wants to craft firearm policy, there’s a mechanism to do that: run for office, and let the voters decide. The American public, and ATF, need a leader who is focused on the mission, not policy debates."

I agree with Sullivan that David Chipman is *not* fit to run the ATF.

When a former ATF Director so forcefully opposes Chipman, you can be sure that Chipman’s confirmation as ATF Director would not just be a "slippery slope" for gun rights. It would be a straight nose-dive into tyranny.

Please oppose the Chipman nomination.
