I am aghast at the proposal of California Assembly Bill 15. That bill is as dangerous and crazy as it is NOT in the Golden State's best interest! Thankfully, Gov. Newsom has already promised to veto A.B. 15.

The implications of such a law are profoundly troubling and threaten the safety and security of Golden State communities. By restricting authorities from detaining individuals who have entered our country illegally and committed crimes in California, we would essentially be prioritizing criminal aliens over California citizens' safety.

It is crucial to acknowledge that illegal immigration must not be supported or normalized through misguided policies. A.B. 15 undermines the rule of law, compromises public safety, and undermines citizens' trust in the state government to protect their interests.

Do better! We need MORE credible immigration enforcement!
