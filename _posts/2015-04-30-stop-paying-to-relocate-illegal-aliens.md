I was outraged to learn that the Obama administration is using taxpayer dollars to bring the children of illegal aliens to the United States. This simply encourages illegal immigration and I urge you to work to defund it.

First, the Obama administration encouraged the border surge and current illegal alien crisis by refusing to secure the border, preventing the enforcement of immigration laws, and then granting de facto amnesty to millions of illegal aliens. Now, they have gone one step further by using federal funds to fly the children of illegal aliens to the United States.

This program is unnecessary and an affront to the American people and the rule of law. I urge you to take steps to stop this misuse of taxpayer dollars.

Sincerely,
