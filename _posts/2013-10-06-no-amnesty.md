Pro-amnesty groups are holding a cynical "Day of Dignity &amp; Respect" for illegal aliens. These groups fail to recognize that an amnesty would undermine those already in the United States legally. Please respect the dignity of legal citizens by drastically and permanently reducing legal immigration.  
  
Rallies planned for 150 cities this weekend as a "National Day of Dignity and Respect for Immigrants" could just as easily be called the "Anti-Labor Day" or the "Immigrant Perpetual Poverty Day."

All American workers suffer under current uncontrolled immigration policies and would suffer much more if the sponsors of the rallies get their "comprehensive immigration reform" that would give lifetime work permits to at least 11 million illegal aliens and around 20 million new legal immigrants over the next ten years.

But the workers who would suffer the most, would be the legal immigrants who arrived here the last 10-20 years.

Please oppose these efforts to harm American and legal immigrant workers. Say no to amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this

P.S. I suspect the true aim of these rallies is not "immigration," but rather revanchism, or the "reconquest" of the United States by foreign invaders through demographics. For America to stay American, it must secure it's borders and repel the invaders from within and without.
