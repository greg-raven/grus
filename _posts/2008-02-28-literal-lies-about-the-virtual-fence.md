So, Department of Homeland Security officials say the "Virtual Fence" that is supposed to secure our southern border is not only poorly conceived and late, it's also not working. The wonderful thing about this announcement is that they make it as if they are trying so hard to secure our border, and this was the best effort they could make. Is anyone really shocked that the DHS can't seem to secure our border under George Bush, who has made it abundantly clear that he wants Mexicans to have free access to the U.S.?

Unfortunately for the Feds, the timing of this announcement reveals both the emptiness of their assurances that they are working for our security, and their true agenda, which is the elimination of borders and the unification of the U.S. and Mexico.

With news pouring out of Arizona that newly passed laws at the state level are causing illegal immigrations to leave the state, anyone with two brain cells to rub together can see that simple enforcement of existing laws yields tremendous gains in this area. If DHS and the Bush administration were really serious about upholding the Constitution, doing the jobs each has sworn to do, and protecting this country from invasion, the announcement of failure in the fence department would have been accompanied by an announcement that U.S. immigration, hiring, and workplace laws would henceforth be enforced.

As it is, their (in)actions speak much louder than their words.
