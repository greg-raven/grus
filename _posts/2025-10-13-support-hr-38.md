As your constituent and a strong supporter of the Second Amendment, I am writing to respectfully urge you to do everything possible to get a vote on H.R. 38, the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act.

Gun Owners of America has kept me informed about the progress of H.R. 38 in Congress, and I am encouraged by the ongoing support for this common-sense legislation. I believe it is critically important that law-abiding citizens with concealed carry permits can exercise their right to self-defense across state lines. What other freedom guaranteed in the Bill of Rights is limited to our home state?

With recent violent incidents in mind, it is more important than ever to allow responsible Americans to protect themselves and their families --- no matter where they travel. National reciprocity maintains respect for statesâ€™ rights while ensuring constitutional freedoms are protected. Law-abiding citizens should not risk becoming accidental criminals simply because they cross a state border.

I strongly urge you to stand with responsible gun owners and support H.R. 38 by becoming a co-sponsor (if you have already cosponsored the bill, thank you!). Please help defend the rights of your constituents and millions of Americans nationwide by advancing this vital legislation.
