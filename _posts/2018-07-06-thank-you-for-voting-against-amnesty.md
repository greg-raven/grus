I am glad that you voted against the Goodlatte-Ryan-Denham amnesty. This bill would have only rewarded illegal aliens and exacerbated our nation's illegal immigration problem. Instead of learning from the mistakes of the 1986 amnesty, this bill would have repeated its mistakes by guaranteeing an amnesty for illegal aliens but only promising border security and enforcement.

I hope you will oppose all no-strings amnesty and only support a DACA amnesty if it ends chain migration and mandates use of the E-Verify system.
