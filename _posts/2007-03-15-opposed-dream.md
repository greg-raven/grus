The DREAM Act is nothing more than an amnesty disguised in a school uniform. Please oppose it.

The DREAM Act (S. 774) would allow states to grant in-state tuition to illegal aliens and in many cases, provide a de facto amnesty by allowing certain teenage illegal aliens to adjust their status and remain in the country. 

In my book, no illegal alien should qualify for amnesty, just as no illegal alien should receive benefits that reward them for remaining in the United States illegally. 

There are plenty of lower-income Americans who need educational assistance. The DREAM Act would give illegal aliens a better chance of success than some of the most vulnerable Americans looking for educational assistance. Is this fair?

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Those are my tax dollars being spent on illegal aliens. If the government has so much money it can spend it on non-taxpaying foreigners, instead it should return it to the source --- me.
