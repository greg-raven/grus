Please push for mandatory E-Verify!

It is really important that Congress pass legislation to mandate the use of the E-Verify system. E-Verify is easy to use and has the highest satisfaction rates of any government program. Requiring employers to run new hires through E-Verify, as government contractors are already required to do, would prevent the hiring of illegal aliens and make it very hard to remain in the country. If people know that employers are forced to run new hires through E-Verify, fewer people will come to the U.S. illegally in search of work.

Please do all you can to get E-Verify use mandated so that Americans can get back to work and illegal immigration reduced.
