I am writing to you today to stand with Firearms Policy Coalition and express my opposition to California Senate Bill 264, which would prevent the use of property owned or leased by the state for the purpose of selling guns or ammunition.

S.B. 264 serves no benefit to the State of California, but it does a disservice to its citizens by preventing them from engaging in commerce at gun shows and non-profit events that frequently use government property. S.B. 264 is intended to prevent people from exercising their rights by cutting off lawful commercial access, and by banning the use of government property, Senator Min's bill will reduce the ability of individuals to lawfully and safely purchase and sell firearms and ammunition.

For these reasons, I would urge you to join me in opposing S.B. 264. Thank you for your time and consideration.
