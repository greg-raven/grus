We urge you to support both S. 3100, the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, and S. 2193, Kate’s Law, when the Senate votes on them. Sanctuary cities provide refuge for dangerous criminals and need to be eliminated. Please vote in favor of these bills and help to protect the American people.

Sanctuary jurisdictions make our entire country less safe by refusing to hand over illegal aliens to ICE for removal proceedings, even if the illegal aliens have a criminal record. The arrogance of these localities is beyond belief and has resulted in the deaths of innocent Americans. By attempting to protect illegal aliens from deportation, they are knowingly and wantonly harboring dangerous illegal aliens. The ramifications of which were sadly played out in San Francisco when an innocent woman was shot by an illegal alien who had been deported five times. This death was preventable and it must serve as a lesson for our communities and our nation.

I hope you will vote in favor of Sens. Toomey and Cruz’s respective bills. S. 3100, the Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, would block sanctuary cities from receiving certain federal funding while S. 2193, “Kate’s Law,” would increase criminal penalties for illegal aliens who reenter the country following removal, including mandatory minimum sentences for aggravated felons or repeat offenders.

Please do all you can to get these bills passed.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
