Constitutional rights do not end at a state border, and states are required to give full faith and credit to legal permits from other states.

That's why Senator Cornyn introduced S. 1522, a concealed carry reciprocity bill that stops anti-gun states like New York and California from cancelling the Second Amendment rights of Americans from other states.

I urge you to cosponsor and push for a recorded vote on S. 1522.

I and millions of other Americans are extremely concerned about the erosion of our Second Amendment rights. Passing this bill would be a small step in the right direction.
