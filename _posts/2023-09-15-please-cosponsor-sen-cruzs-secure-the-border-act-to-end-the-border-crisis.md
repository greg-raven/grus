Sen. Ted Cruz has introduced the Senate version of the House-passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. This legislation, if passed by the Senate, would help to end the crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border. This legislation would:

- plug the loopholes in our asylum system that are exploited by illegal economic migrants, restoring its integrity and protecting it for legitimate asylum seekers;
- block the government from continuing its policies of catch-and-release, thus deterring future waves of illegal migrants;
- put a stop to the surges of family units and unaccompanied alien children, protecting them from exploitation and victimization by the cartels and traffickers;
- put teeth into efforts to deter visa overstays;
- rein in the breathtaking and illegal abuse of parole; and
- institute mandatory nationwide E-Verify, which would shut off the "jobs magnet" for illegal immigration while protecting jobs for American workers.

As you can see, the Secure the Border Act is an incredibly important piece of legislation that would help to end the crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border. Please cosponsor this bill!
