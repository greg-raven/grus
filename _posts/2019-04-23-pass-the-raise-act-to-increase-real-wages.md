Americans need a raise --- please help push the RAISE Act through Congress.

Real wages are still below wages in the 1970s. That's why I am again asking you to reduce immigration and pass the RAISE Act. The resulting tightened labor market will give Americans a raise.

The United States allows in 1 million new foreign workers each year, a number that allows businesses to continue to pay substandard wages. In fact, immigration has kept the labor market so loose that real wages are still below those of the 1970s.

According to Pew Research, "in real terms, average hourly earnings peaked more than 45 years ago: The $4.03-an-hour rate recorded in January 1973 had the same purchasing power that $23.68 would today." The business lobbyists clamoring for more foreign workers certainly don't act like they are aware of that.

Many of your Congressional colleagues are saying the same thing, but if there were truly a shortage of potential workers in the country, wages would be much higher.

Americans need a raise, I hope you will make that happen by helping to push the RAISE Act through Congress.
