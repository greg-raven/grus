As long as the United States is a member of the United Nations, our Constitutional rights are in danger. Even if we do not actively participate in totalitarian schemes like their "Arms Trade Treaty" (ATT), maintaining our membership in the U.N. makes it easier for any future President to push for ratification of the ATT or sign us onto the next anti-gun treaty.

That's why your colleague Mike Rogers of Alabama introduced H.R. 193 --- The American Sovereignty Restoration Act --- which terminates U.S. membership in, and funding of, the U.N.

I urge you to cosponsor and vote it favor of H.R. 193. I and other gun owners and activists are counting on you to help retain our rights.
