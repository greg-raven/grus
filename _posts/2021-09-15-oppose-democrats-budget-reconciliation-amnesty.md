The Democrats’ budget reconciliation amnesty shows an abject disregard for the plight of American workers and the safety and security of our nation. Border Patrol and CPB agents need additional resources to deal with the influx of illegal economic migrants. Instead, the Democrats have chosen to use the budget reconciliation process to amnesty millions of illegal aliens, thereby exacerbating the border crisis and making it even more difficult to secure the border.

To make matters worse, the budget doesn’t include one extra cent in border security funds and actually freezes interior enforcement so that illegal aliens are not apprehended and deported before they can receive an amnesty. What are they thinking?

I hope you will stand up for our national security by opposing the Democrats’ budget.
