Representative Brian Bilbray,

Speaker of the House John Boehner has asked all of his Representatives to focus on one area: jobs. I agree with him that putting Americans back to work is a top priority. With this in mind, I urge you to support the Legal Workforce Act (H.R. 2885), which provides a superabundance of means for illegal aliens to be dispossessed of their U.S. jobs, thus allowing the 22 million Americans without a full-time job a chance of filling them.

A huge loophole in our current system involves illegal aliens who at an earlier time had a valid Social Security number, usually because they were legal temporary foreign workers. The problem has been that once the work visa expires, the Social Security number doesn’t. The Social Security numbers don’t even expire if persons holding them are deported.

The Legal Workforce Act slams the door shut on this egregious loophole by locking out Social Security numbers that are attached to expired visas and deportees. Illegal aliens with these locked Social Security numbers would not get through E-Verify to be hired and would be identified in the no-match process if they are already in the workforce.

The Legal Workforce Act is a great bill that would ensure that those with valid Social Security numbers, but without permission to work in the United States, would not be able to take jobs from American workers and legal immigrants with work permissions.

Illegal aliens currently hold jobs in a wide range of areas: construction, computer programming, housekeeping, manufacturing, transportation, et al. H.R. 2885 would put Americans, representing a wide swath of educational attainments, back to work. I suggest you heed Speaker Boehner’s advice and make job creation your top priority. Supporting the Legal Workforce Act to the hilt would be a great place to start.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
