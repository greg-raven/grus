I cannot understand why reputable news organizations continue to say that Catholic Americans overwhelmingly support giving legal status, work permits, and a pathway to citizenship to illegal aliens when recent polling shows that the opposite is true.  
  
Pulse Opinion Research asked Catholic voters the following question: "How much moral responsibility do you feel Congress has to help protect the ability of current illegal immigrants to hold a job and support their families without fear of deportation?"

Only 14% of Catholic voters answered "a lot," while 27% answered "some," 26% answered "very little," and 28% said none.

While Catholics are definitely not uniformly against helping illegal immigrants, most Catholic voters are against doing much to help them keep their jobs and displace American workers. I hope you will take a close look at this poll and realize that most Catholics oppose granting work permits to illegal immigrants while millions of Americans search for a job.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. The Catholic man-in-the-street is better informed than his so-call church leaders.
