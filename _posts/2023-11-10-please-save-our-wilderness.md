- Reduce America's high population growth.

America loses about 1.5 million acres of wilderness every year, mostly due to agriculture, energy development, and housing sprawl, which is being driven by our growing population. This is an alarming trend because wilderness provides ecological services that are vital to human life, such as producing clean air and water, and by regulating climate, pollution, pollination, and floods.

Unfortunately, current immigration policy accelerates the loss of America's wilderness by promoting rapid population growth. The Census Bureau predicts that the U.S. population will grow by 75 million people by the Year 2060, with roughly 90 percent of that growth resulting from immigration. This projection does not account for illegal immigration, which has been twice as high as legal immigration since 2021.

The most practical way for America to achieve a more sustainable immigration policy is to stop the abuses of parole and asylum which have been rampant under the Biden administration. Please include H.R. 2, The Secure The Border Act, in the next Federal funding bill.
