As a candidate, you made numerous promises regarding illegal immigration, including building a wall. Clearly, you are not going to make good on that promise any time soon.

While I approve of some of the other actions you have taken to get illegal immigration (and illegal immigrants in this country) under control, there is much, much more you can do, whether or not you ever actually build a wall or not.

First and foremost, you must mandate that employers use E-Verify for all employees.

Second, you must start taking steps immediately to disqualify illegal aliens from receiving any and all financial support of any kind, whether it be free education, free food, free phones, free non-critical medical attention, subsidies, work permits, etc. Each of these should be ended, but in those cases where this is not possible, at the very least you must defund these programs.

Third, you must make good on your campaign promise to end Obama's DACA amnesty and work permits, and to remove these persons to their countries of origin.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you wish to discuss this.
