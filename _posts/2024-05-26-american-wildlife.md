Even though we just had another Earth Day celebration, America still suffers from a "biodiversity crisis." The list of endangered and threatened species (now over 1,300) gets bigger our nation loses about 1.5 million acres of natural lands every year because unsustainable population growth demands evermore agriculture, energy development, and housing sprawl. As a result, critical wildlife habitat areas are destroyed and/or disconnected.

America's population cannot grow indefinitely and steps must be taken to achieve authentic sustainability. Given its outsized role in driving America's population growth, immigration must be reduced to prevent further irreversible environmental impacts. Please support H.R. 7833, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, which limits chain migration to spouses and minor children.
