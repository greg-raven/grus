Please oppose the Sentencing Reform Act of 2015 as it is currently written. This legislation would release thousands of dangerous non-citizen offenders at a time when the Obama administration has shown a refusal to deport even the most violent criminal aliens.

The refusal of the Obama administration to deport criminal aliens, combined with the prevalence of sanctuary cities, makes the passage of the Sentencing Reform Act a very dangerous proposition. 25% of all federal trafficking convictions and 77% of all drug possession convictions are handed down to non-citizens, with many of these being members of violent gangs such as MS-13.

Countless Americans have been maimed and murdered by criminal illegal aliens. Kate Steinle by murdered by an illegal alien who the San Fransisco Police Department refused to hand over to ICE. Countless other Americans, including law enforcement officers, are victims of the administration's refusal to enforce the law.

Passing the Sentencing Reform Act in its current form would put more criminal aliens on our streets. This is avoidable and I am counting on your to prevent it from occurring. Please oppose this legislation until it safeguards Americans from non-citizen criminals.
