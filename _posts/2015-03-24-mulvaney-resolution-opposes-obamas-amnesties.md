I am glad that you voted against the revised DHS funding bill that stripped amnesty defunding language from the legislation. Please continue to stick up for jobless Americans, the rule of law, and our nation’s security by cosponsoring H. Con. Res. 28, introduced by Rep. Mick Mulvaney, which expresses the sense of Congress that President Obama’s amnesties are illegal and were not approved by Congress through passage of H.R. 240.

President Obama’s amnesties are an affront to the rule of law and funding them set a dangerous precedent. The funding of these amnesties was dangerous because it gave carte blanche to this president to usurp Congress’ authority on any issue he wants and I am glad you opposed the bill. Congress must now as act as one to show their disapproval for the president’s actions.

Rep. Mick Mulvaney’s H. Con. Res. 28 says:

> “Whereas the passage of H.R. 240 to fund the Department of Homeland Security and protect against ongoing terrorist threats could be misconstrued as the consent of Congress to the President’s illegal and unconstitutional executive amnesty:
> 
> “Now, therefore, be it resolved by the House of Representatives (the Senate concurring), that Congress affirms that the actions taken by the President to implement executive amnesty exceed his constitutional authority, and thus are unlawful.”

I hope you will cosponsor H. Con. Res. 28 and prove once more that you are against the president’s amnesties.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
