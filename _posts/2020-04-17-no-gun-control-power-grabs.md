WHEREAS: The Second Amendment to the United States Constitution protects the individual right to keep and bear arms; and

WHEREAS: Anti-gun politicians are using the COVID-19 crisis to impose "emergency" unconstitutional gun control measures; and

WHEREAS: If you and I don’t fight back now to protect our Second Amendment freedoms, they will be stripped away.

THEREFORE: I urge my Congressman, U.S. Senators, as well as my politicians to stand against using COVID-19 as an excuse to impose unconstitutional gun control measures.
