Please veto SB 1460 and AB 1413. Both bills will greatly add to California’s desperate financial situation.  
  
There are currently 10 states which allow illegal aliens to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities. This is a clear violation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which was passed by the Congress and signed by President Clinton. Section 8 USC 1623 reads: “… an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit …” Please do not add California to this list.

I supported your prior vetoes of bills that provide in-state tuition and financial aid to illegal aliens. Now, given the state’s financial crisis, it is even more important to prevent such legislation from becoming law. I look forward to your vetoes of SB 1460 and AB 1413.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Despite your lies to the contrary, illegal aliens and anchor babies are massive drain on our economy. Secure our border and evict the illegals and anchor babies already here, before they completely destroy the rest of California!
