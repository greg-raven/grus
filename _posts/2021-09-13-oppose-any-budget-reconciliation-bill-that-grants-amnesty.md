Democrats are making a terrible error by trying to use the budget reconciliation process to issue permanent work permits to 8 million illegal border crossers and visa overstayers. This is especially true while human smugglers and cartels make billions of dollars promising impoverished Central Americans that illegal immigration pays off.

Our country is suffering from the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic and the ongoing border crisis; importing hundreds of thousands of new foreign workers (on top of your proposed legalization) shows a complete disregard for the plight of American workers. It, quite frankly, makes the Democratic Party appear to be callous and radical with bad politics and bad policies.

Please do all you can to strip the immigration provisions out of the final reconciliation bill, or to vote against the final passage!

P.S. Secure our borders now, evict from the country anyone who does not belong here, and institute a 20-year moratorium on all new immigration including refugees.
