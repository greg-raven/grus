I believe in welcoming immigrants to America, and having a humane immigration system that respects the dignity of every person. However, I'm concerned about how big our population will grow and, in turn, the fate of our nation's wilderness areas.

Early in his residency, Resident Biden issued an executive order directing federal officials to protect 30% of the country's lands and oceans by 2030 (i.e., "30×30"). The Administration, and the environmental community, saw this plan as a way to protect and preserve America's most biologically rich ecosystems. But by essentially accelerating America's population growth, Congress's approach to immigration contradicts the 30×30 conservation plan.

The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that, at today's growth rate, America's population will reach 404 million in 40 years, and more than 90% of this increase will be from immigration. That's why I am urging you to support measures for reducing our high immigration rates (e.g., limit chain migration) so that our open spaces can stay that way for generations to come.

P.S. No more immigrants. No more refugees. No more asylum-seekers. Secure the border, eject those already here illegally, and see how much better things will be in 60 years.
