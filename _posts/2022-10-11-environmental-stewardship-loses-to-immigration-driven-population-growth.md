I'm concerned about the persistent environmental degradation in America, such as water shortages, biodiversity loss, deforestation, pollution, and traffic congestion. It's clear that we will never be able to resolve these problems without the gradual transition to population stabilization.

The Democratic Party needs to get back to its traditional values of protecting America's environment and the biodiversity of life, which cannot happen as long as our population continues to rapidly grow. There needs to be an acceptance about the adverse impacts from America's relentless population growth, and especially the primary source of that growth --- immigration. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our country is poised to gain another 75 million people by 2060 --- with roughly 90% due to immigration.

America's only realistic hope for a sustainable future is to take steps to reduce our high immigration rates. Please support immigration legislation (e.g., limit "chain migration") that would lower America's rapid population growth and help our country achieve authentic sustainability.
