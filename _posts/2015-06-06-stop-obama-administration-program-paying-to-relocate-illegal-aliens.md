I was outraged to learn that the Obama administration is using taxpayer dollars to bring the children of illegal aliens to the United States. This simply encourages illegal immigration and I urge you to work to defund it.

There is simply no rationale for the Obama administration to continue to encourage and abet illegal immigration. It's bad enough that the administration caused the current illegal immigration crisis by refusing to enforce the law or secure the border. To make matters worse, the administration decided to amnesty millions of illegal aliens. Now, the Obama administration is using taxpayer dollars to fly the children of illegal aliens to the United States. All of these actions simply encourage more and more illegal aliens to come to the United States.

I urge you to finally put an end to our government's refusal to secure our nation's borders and enforce the law. Until this occurs, illegal aliens will continue to come to the United States in search of amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
