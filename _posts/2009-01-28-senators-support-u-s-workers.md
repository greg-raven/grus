The United States lets over 140,000 foreign workers enter our country each month. This number is absurd considering our current unemployment numbers.

Resident-elect Obama promised to protect American jobs and I urge you to do all you can help him accomplish this goal by supporting policies that crack down on illegal employers who profit by exploiting an illegal workforce. With 6 million illegal workers currently holding non-farm jobs, Congress should reauthorize and expand E-Verify under the SAVE Act to help employers put Americans and legal immigrants into these jobs.

NumbersUSA has sent a request to Resident-elect Obama requesting him curb chain migration, the visa lottery, and the importation of foreign workers. It goes without saying that I completely approve of NumbersUSA's letter and their suggestions. These suggestions are not cure-all solution, but would certainly create millions of jobs for unemployed Americans.

I urge you to do call you can to assist Resident-elect Obama in creating and protecting American jobs. Millions of Americans are counting on you.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
