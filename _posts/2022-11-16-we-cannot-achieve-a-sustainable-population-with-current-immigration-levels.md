It's frustrating that America's prominent economists can't acknowledge that economic growth does not require a relentless increase in population. We can grow our economy by using education and technology to increase productivity. With slower population growth, we can make greater progress toward resolving economic and environmental issues while boosting our productivity, and quality of life, as a nation.

The real problem is too many people. There are few environmental problems not exacerbated by population growth --- global warming, the extinction crisis, water shortages, polluted air and water, deforestation, wetlands destruction, increased trash and toxic waste, sprawling development and loss of open space, depleted fisheries, and increased farm pollution.

Given that immigration is driving almost all U.S. population growth, immigration must be reduced to well below current levels. To relieve the growing pressures on our environment, please work to stabilize the U.S. population by reducing immigration (e.g., limit "chain migration").

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
