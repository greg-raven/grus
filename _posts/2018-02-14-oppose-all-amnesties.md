I am asking you to oppose both the Susan Collins immigration proposal and the McCain/Coons immigration proposal. I am opposed to any and all amnesties, including DACA amnesty. We need to bolster border security, mandate E-Verify, end chain migration, end the visa lottery, stop taking refugees, and cut off the flow of guest workers. Please do everything you can to eliminate illegal immigration, and to reduce legal immigration to a tiny fraction of its current value.
