I have heard that there is a handful of Senators, along with some in the White House, who are looking to slip an INCREASE of legal immigration into the emergency spending bills currently being drafted to deal with the coronavirus outbreak.

The provision being discussed would increase the number of EB-5 visas from 10,000 to 75,000. The EB-5 visa program provides foreign nationals with a green card in return for an investment in an American business that leads to the creation of at least 10 jobs for American workers. Currently, investors have to invest at least $900,000, but the provision could reduce that amount to $450,000.

Quite simply, the EB-5 visa program is the selling of U.S. citizenship. Itâ€™s ridiculous to think that while Americans are concerned about their jobs and their health, some Senators are looking for ways to benefit foreign nationals instead.

Please oppose any efforts to slip an EB-5 increase into the economic stimulus package. Congress should not be supporting bad immigration policy, especially not by burying it into emergency bills.
