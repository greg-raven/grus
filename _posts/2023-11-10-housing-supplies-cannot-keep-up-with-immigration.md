- We need H.R. 2.

Soaring housing costs are making the affordable housing shortage worse, and has led to a dramatic rise in homelessness. According to the *Wall Street Journal* (8/14/23), homelessness in America had a record spike from 2022 to 2023. Now state and municipal officials are being forced to frantically search to find housing for many thousands of new migrants, while thousands more have no choice but to live out on the streets.

Communities are facing a harsh reality --- the sharp lack of affordable homes, shelter, tax money to help every migrant in need. Out of desperation, towns and cities have tried everything from paying for hotel rooms to converting school gymnasiums and giant tents into temporary shelters.

As you must know, illegal immigration has been hitting historic highs (twice as high as legal). We need leaders like you to fight for the homeless and those facing impossible housing costs. A critical step toward stabilizing our housing demands would be to include H.R. 2, The Secure The Border Act, in any future funding bill.
