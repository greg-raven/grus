I am a California voter who wants you to block passage of SB 54. Preventing police from communicating with ICE about criminal aliens is dangerous and violates federal law. Police may not know what convictions or other offenses are on a person’s record, or who that person really is, unless they communicate with ICE. Do not play politics with our safety and well being.

It is false to claim that sanctuary policies are needed to protect witnesses or crime victims who are unlawfully present. They are already protected under the federal “U” visa, and there is no research that suggests crime reporting increases in sanctuary jurisdictions.

Advocates for SB 54 are on the wrong side of the law and the wrong side of voters who support Trump’s crackdown by large margins.

Block SB 54.
