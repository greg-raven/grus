Congress must FIX and PASS HR 38 today! I stand with Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC) in asking you to fix the problems listed below

Unless we fix and pass H.R. 38:

- Simple mistakes could lead to arrest, prison time, and lifelong loss of rights.

- Americans would need 51 different licenses to exercise 1 right.

- Gun owners would not be able to lawfully carry throughout the United States without massive risk and insane costs.

## There are 3 Most Major Problems with H.R. 38 That Must Be Fixed

### Problem # 1 --- Forgot your wallet? Go to jail.

**Flaw:** H.R. 38 requires a person to carry a government-issued photo ID and carry license at all times when they are armed. Just forgetting your wallet or purse could lead to serious, life-altering criminal charges, prosecution, and potentially even a lifetime loss of rights. 

**FPC fix:** Ensure peaceable people aren't jailed for honest mistakes

### Problem # 2 --- Legal traps everywhere.

**Flaw:** H.R. 38 allows states and local governments to ban carry on all public property, defeating the very point of the bill and setting a legal trap for gun owners in these unmarked "gun-free" zones.

**FPC fix:** Guarantee carry rights in non-secured public places nationwide.

### Problem # 3 --- The felony under your floormat.

**Flaw:** H.R. 38 only protects one handgun, one magazine, and only the ammunition loaded into them. Extra magazines or ammunition, a back-up firearm, or even a single loose round in a purse or under a floormat wouldn't be covered—putting gun owners at risk of arrest and prosecution. 

**FPC fix:** Ensure that people are fully protected while carrying and travelling with firearms.

- H.R. 38 matters for all gun owners --- even in "constitutional carry" states

- Even in permitless carry states, you're not safe from federal charges. 18 U.S.C. § 922(q), the federal "gun-free school zone" law, bans carry within 1,000 feet of schools unless a person has a carry license issued by every state they carry in. 
State-level constitutional carry and permit reciprocity doesn't solve this.

- Americans are being federally prosecuted under this law right now.

So please address the issues listed above and then pass H.R. 38!
