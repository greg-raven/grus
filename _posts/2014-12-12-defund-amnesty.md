Pres. Obama has announced his executive action on immigration that will allow an estimated 5 million illegal aliens to receive deferred action from removal and obtain Social Security numbers and work permits. This is a slap in the face to the 18 million of Americans who want a full-time job, but can't find one and the millions of foreign citizens who are waiting in line.

With a questionable use of executive authority, Pres. Obama has announced that he is expanding his 2012 DACA directive to grant amnesty and work permits to an estimated 5 million illegal aliens. Additionally, his action will help foreign tech workers live and work in the United States.

This action has come under heavy fire from Democrats and Republicans alike. Newly re-elected Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire said she "would not support a piecemeal approach issued by executive order." The President, himself, on more than 20 occasions has said he doesn't have the authority to expand DACA. What changed?

You have the power to stop this unlawful action by using Congress' power of the purse. I strongly urge you to defund the President's action through the normal budgetary process.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
