Please do not allow the federal government to house illegal aliens in our state. The Obama administration is responsible for the influx at the border and should not be forcing our state to deal with the consequences.

The Washington Times and other news outlets reported that HHS and DHS wanted to use an abandoned office building in downtown Baltimore to house 9,500 illegal aliens who have crossed the border illegally in recent weeks. However, opposition from local residents and politicians has put a halt to the plan.

Democratic Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and Democratic U.S. Senators Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin were all opposed to the idea and made that clear to the federal government.

Baltimore is just one of many cities around the country that have stood up and rejected government plans to impose illegal aliens upon them. I hope you will stand up for our state if the federal government tries to do the same to us.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. First, they should be deported immediately, not housed anywhere in the U.S. Second, we keep hearing about the seriousness of the water shortage here in California; why not mitigate it by kicking out all our illegals and prevent others from entering?
