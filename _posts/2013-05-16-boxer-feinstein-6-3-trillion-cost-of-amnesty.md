We wanted to make sure you were aware of the Heritage Foundation's new study which conclusively proves that the amnesty provisions of the Gang of Eight's comprehensive amnesty bill would cost U.S. taxpayers at least $6.3 trillion. This is in addition to the costs caused by the importation of 22 million legal immigrants over the first decade of the bill. We know you realize that America cannot afford to amnesty 11 million illegal aliens, as doing so would force Congress to reduce spending on services to those Americans most in need. Please oppose this bill.  
  
There's no doubt about it, America's immigration system is broken. Our broken system has allowed 11 million illegal aliens to live and, in most cases, work in our country without fear of arrest or deportation. On top of that, our broken system has allowed U.S. businesses to bring in more than 1 million foreign workers each year at a time when 20 million Americans cannot find a full-time job and tens of millions more have left the work force in disgust.

However, legislation that gives work permits, green cards, and U.S. citizenship to 11 million illegal aliens, at the cost of $6.3 trillion, is certainly not the answer. I hope you will oppose this bill and allow the federal government to spend this money on services that are essential to tens of millions of Americans.
