U.S. tech talent struggle to find work. Limit immigration.

It is outrageous for officials to contemplate more immigration when many expect U.S. unemployment to rise significantly soon.

*The Washington Post* published opinion columnist Heather Long's article "'Soft landing' is a terrible name for what's coming" wherein she asserts:

> "The reality is that a substantial number of Americans will experience pain even if the country doesn't technically fall into a recession. A more appropriate term is probably a "forced landing" or an "emergency landing" ... Even the normally optimistic New York Fed President John Williams predicted unemployment could rise to 5 percent, up from the current 3.7 percent. That means about 2 million people would lose their jobs."

With unemployment possibly reaching 5 percent soon, Congress should adopt sensible immigration policy that is fair to U.S. workers and their families.
