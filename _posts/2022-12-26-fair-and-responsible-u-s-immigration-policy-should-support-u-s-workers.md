U.S. tech talent struggle to find work. Limit immigration.

It is outrageous for officials to contemplate more immigration when many expect U.S. unemployment to rise significantly soon.

The Washington Post published opinion columnist Heather Long's article "'Soft landing' is a terrible name for what's coming" wherein she asserts:

> "The reality is that a substantial number of Americans will experience pain even if the country doesn't technically fall into a recession. A more appropriate term is probably a "forced landing" or an "emergency landing" ... Even the normally optimistic New York Fed President John Williams predicted unemployment could rise to 5 percent, up from the current 3.7 percent. That means about 2 million people would lose their jobs."

With unemployment possibly reaching 5 percent soon, Congress should adopt sensible immigration policy that is fair to U.S. workers and their families.
