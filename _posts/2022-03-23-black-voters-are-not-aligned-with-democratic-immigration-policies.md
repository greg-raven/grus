Do you support Black workers or favor importing foreign workers?

Only 19% of Black voters back Democratic leadership that prefers to import foreign workers to keep costs and prices down over encouraging businesses to raise wages despite the potential for prices to rise. It concerns me that the Democratic party’s policies don’t align. Why is there an insistence on abandoning voters in favor of corporatist immigration policies? I urge you to pay attention to constituents that want to bolster Black communities and start having your actions reflect your words.
