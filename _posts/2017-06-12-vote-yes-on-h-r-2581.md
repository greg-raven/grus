Rep. Lou Barletta (R-Pa.) has introduced the Verify First Act, H.R. 2581, to ensure that illegal aliens cannot qualify for taxpayer-funded health insurance credits.

The Senate Committee on Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs reported that more than $700 million in Obamacare subsidies had been paid to ineligible aliens by 2015. The Verify First Act simply requires the Social Security Administration (SSA) and the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to actually verify the citizenship or immigration status of every applicant for a credit under the AHCA before the Treasury Department issues the credit.

Hard-working Americans and legal residents already are struggling to pay for their own health care. There is simply no excuse for the Federal government to force them to subsidize health care for illegal aliens through taxpayer-funded credits.

Please support America and Americans by voting yes on H.R. 2581.

Sincerely,
