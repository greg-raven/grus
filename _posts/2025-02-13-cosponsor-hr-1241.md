Please co-sponsor H.R. 1241, the Security and Fairness Enhancement (SAFE) for America Act., which would fulfill a key recommendation of the bi-partisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by Barbara Jordan.

This bill would end the U.S. visa lottery program, which randomly gives out 55,000 green cards each year through a drawing. U.S. citizenship is worth more than the $330 processing fee and a bit of luck.

A better immigration system would not be random but would consider how immigrants contribute to our society.

Please help to sustain a credible immigration system based on merit by cosponsoring H.R. 1241.
