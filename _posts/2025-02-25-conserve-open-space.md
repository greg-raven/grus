Biodiversity in America needs sustainable immigration levels.

I am very concerned about the decline of America's wildlife and overall biodiversity, which is due to habitat loss from relentless population growth. Over 1,000 native species plants and animals are endangered or threatened today. They need critical habitat to survive, and we keep destroying it in order to accommodate more of us --- projected to be around 375 million by 2060.

President Biden pledged to of "30 percent of U.S. lands and waters by 2030." Instead, he allowed over seven million illegal immigrants into the United Statas in just four years. This in addition to the over 4 million green that were issued during his term. Conserving America's open spaces and protecting biodiversity cannot happen as long as mass immigration to the U.S. continues. 

To reduce population pressures on our wildlife and wilderness areas, please support immigration legislation (e.g., real border security, ending "chain migration," mandatory E-Verify), to help lower America's rapid population growth and allow us to preserve our natural resources for future generations.
