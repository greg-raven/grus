I'm writing to ask you to KILL ObamaCare Bill H.R. 3962. I'm not going to ask you to read it or point out the manifold egregious provisions of this bill. You don't need to go to that effort because this bill is --- like Resident Obama and a fair number of our "representatives" in D.C. --- utterly un-American, and must be rejected.  
  
Government control of healthcare is immoral, corrosive of the fabric of our society, and unconstitutional. In this, I include not only the bills currently under consideration, but all the existing federal intrusions into health care, such as Medicare, Medicaid, and various executive orders and bureaucratic decisions that force healthcare providers to dispense expensive treatments for free to illegal aliens and indigents.

If you really want to reform healthcare in America, you don't need 1,990 pages of country-destroying text. All you need to do is outlaw medical insurance and give tax write-offs for medical savings plans. The fact that Obama, Pelosi, and Reid are not going this route is proof that they have no intention of "reforming" health care; they're after total control of all aspects of our society by the federal government.

Sincerely,
