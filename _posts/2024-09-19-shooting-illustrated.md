In Tatiana Whitlock's "Spicy Disaster Drill" (*Shooting Illustrated,* October 2024, p. 24) she mentions Murphy's Law but leaves out Vince Lombardi's saying: "Practice does not make perfect. Only perfect practice makes perfect." Her drill has would-be self-defense shooters training for one shot on the first target, two on the second, and three on the third. This would be horrible in a defensive situation. Instead, shooters should practice boarding house rules: Everyone gets firsts before anyone gets seconds. That is, shoot each target once before you shoot any target twice. In a boarding-house-rules drill, you shoot the first target(s) once each, the last target twice, and then go back to shoot the other target(s) once each, addressing them in order of the threat they pose in terms of weapons and proximity.

In Jim Wilson's "Point Shooting" column (p. 54), it would have been nice if he had mentioned Chuck Taylor's Speed Rock method of shooting at bad breath distances. The way Mr. Taylor performed this technique was truly impressive.
