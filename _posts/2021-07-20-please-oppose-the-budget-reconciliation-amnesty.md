I was alarmed to learn that Congressional Democrats are plotting to include a massive amnesty for illegal aliens in the upcoming budget reconciliation bill. In addition to violating the Byrd Rule, an amnesty for illegal aliens would only exacerbate the border crisis by encouraging more people to illegally cross the border.

Human smugglers and drug traffickers are taking advantage of the Biden administration's decision to welcome illegal aliens and the situation will only get worse if true leadership isn't shown on this issue. Apprehensions at the border are at a 20-year high, apprehensions of unaccompanied alien children (UAC) are at an all-time high, DHS has failed to transfer UACs in a timely manner, and DHS has removed the lowest number of illegal aliens on record (including those with final orders of removal and criminal convictions). Moreover, there have been more than 170,000 border apprehensions each of the past three months. Now is the wrong time to pass any amnesty legislation.

I hope you and your colleagues will oppose the budget reconciliation bill if it amnesties illegal aliens.

Sincerely

P.S. We need as much border control as we can possibly get, both to protect this country and to protect its legal workforce.
