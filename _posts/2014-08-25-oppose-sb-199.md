I stand with CAL-FFL and the Firearms Policy Coalition in my OPPOSITION to the ban of popular BB guns.

SB 199 seeks to include certain BB guns in the definition of "imitation firearms," creating criminal liability for millions of Californians who use these products for sport and recreation.

SB 199 is part of a strange legislative heritage that attempts to alter human behavior by way of colored pieces of plastic, paint schemes, and adhesive fluorescent bands.

The legislature's seemingly endless need to alter the definition and coloration of toys and BB guns is exceeded only by its desire to create criminal liability for otherwise law-abiding persons.

For these reasons I must oppose S.B. 199 and urge a NO vote.
