Shame on you for your vote in favor of S. 2611. 

I have contacted you several times prior to the final vote on S. 2611 to express my opposition to the massive amnesty-guestworker bill. My guess is that you have heard from others in our state who oppose it as well. 

In spite of that public opposition, you chose to vote in favor of this bill to add 66 million greencards for foreign workers and their dependents over the next 20 years and to reward approximately 10 million illegal aliens with amnesty. 

Seems to me you've got some explaining to do.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. There is no legitimate reason to reward foreign law-breakers at the expense of American citizens (i.e., your constituents, whom you claim to represent).
