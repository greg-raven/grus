I am absolutely appalled by your amnesty program. How dare you!

In March 2011, at a Univision Town Hall in Washington, DC, you said you simply couldn't "suspend deportations." You said, "With respect to the notion that I can just suspend deportations through executive order, that's just not the case, because there are laws on the books that Congress has passed."

What has changed since then? Has Congress changed the law? Do Americans approve of amnesty for illegal aliens? Are there drastically fewer jobless Americans? No, there is an election coming up and you believe that your electorate is alright with an amnesty for illegal aliens when 20 million Americans cannot find a full-time job.

I find your playing politics with the lives of millions of Americans to be despicable. American families are going hungry and losing their homes because of unemployment and you are giving work permits to illegal aliens simply to win votes. This is partisan politics at its very worst and you should be ashamed of yourself. Sadly, I know you have none.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Let's face it: You are a sociopathic, lying sack of shit. As with everything else you've done since usurping the office of the presidency, this is anti-America, unconstitutional, immoral, and self-serving.
