Please support the Meadows/Jordan amendments to the upcoming spending bill!

There are three main problems forcing DHS to catch and release illegal aliens:

1. Asylum applicants must have a "credible fear of persecution" or they are returned to their home country. Currently, standards for this claim are too loose, as claims have gone from 5,000 in 2009 to 94,000 in 2016. A shortage of immigration judges means that these aliens are often released into the interior pending hearings that may be years into the future.

2. Per the Trafficking Victims Protection Act, minors who arrive in the country from countries other than Mexico and Canada are placed in a longer removal process and supervised by HHS instead of DHS. It has been the HHS practice to place children from noncontiguous countries with guardians in the United States. According to the Center for Immigration Studies, more than 56,000 of unaccompanied children arriving from noncontiguous countries between February 2014 and September 2015 were placed with parents or guardians in the United States, 80 percent of the overall total.

3. The 1997 Flores Settlement has been read as creating a presumption of release for all alien minors, even those that arrive with their parents. As a result, from FY16 to April 2018, more than 150,000 family units and 100,000 unaccompanied alien children were released into the interior.

The Meadows/Jordan amendments would allow DHS to end catch and release by closing the asylum loophole by requiring that the initial credible fear claim meet a "preponderance of the evidence" standard, which would significantly reduce the number of claims filed by aliens who don't have a legitimate case for asylum, fixing the loopholes in the law that continue the surge of unaccompanied alien children at the border, and allowing the feds to detain minors who cross the border illegally for more than 20 days. I urge you to support their passage and help to reduce illegal immigration to the United States.
