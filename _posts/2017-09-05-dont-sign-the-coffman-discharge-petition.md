Rep. Mike Coffman (R-Colo.) announced last week that he will start a Discharge Petition in the House to force a floor vote on his BRIDGE Act that would make Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) permanent --- the unconstitutional Obama executive amnesty that allows younger illegal aliens to receive work permits.

A Discharge Petition is a procedure used, typically by a Member of the minority Party in the House, to force the House Speaker to bring a bill to the floor for a vote. Rarely, does a Member of the Party that controls the House file a Discharge Petition.

Rep. Coffman's Discharge Petition needs 218 signatures to force a vote on the BRIDGE Act. Assuming every Democrat signs the petition, Rep. Coffman also would need 22 Republicans to sign on to force a vote. The BRIDGE Act currently has 12 Republican cosponsors in addition to Coffman.

I am writing to urge you: Do not sign Coffman's petition. Do not cosponsor it, or support it in any way. Talk to your fellow representatives and urge them not to cosponsor or support this petition in any way.

End DACA, end special favors for illegals, end special favors that elevate one class above others, and end the attacks on legal American workers.
