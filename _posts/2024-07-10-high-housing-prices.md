The recent surge in immigration is worsening America's affordable housing crisis. While Americans are being squeezed by rising housing costs due to inflation and elevated interest rates, our nation's unprecedented influx of illegal immigrants is amplifying the demand for scarce housing.

Blue-collar Americans are especially vulnerable to mass immigration because they are more likely to live in rental housing, which means they're going to be in direct competition with migrants, not just in the job market but in the housing market as well.

Congress should have sent the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2) and the Nuclear Family Priority Act (H.R. 7833) to the president's desk so we can regain control over our nation's unprecedented levels of immigration.
