I am writing to express concern about the “Homeowner Protection Program” Joint Powers Authority (JPA), which was created by the County of San Bernardino on April 10, 2012.  
  
I am not in favor of using eminent domain to “assist” financially distressed homeowners, including acquiring residential mortgage loans by voluntarily purchase or using eminent domain.

Signed,

Greg Raven
