As your constituent, I ask that you fight to defend, advance, and secure my freedom, as required by your oath of office.

This includes working to confirm President Donald Trump’s political appointees and pro-gun judicial nominees, defending his pro-gun executive actions, passing national right-to-carry reciprocity into law, restoring the Second Amendment rights of America’s military veterans, and eliminating so-called “gun-free zones” that render law-abiding Americans defenseless.

Thank you.
