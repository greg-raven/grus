Sanctuary cities are out of control and put themselves, and illegal aliens, above the law. This disregard for the law has cost scores of innocent Americans their lives. H.R. 3003, legislation that would help to end this lawless activity, will receive a House floor vote this week and I urge you to support it.

While this legislation is a great first step, more must be done to truly strengthen interior enforcement. H.R. 2431, the Davis-Oliver Act, would go much further to protect our communities and ensure that immigration laws are observed and enforced and it is important that this bill receives a House floor vote as well.

Please vote for H.R. 3003 when it comes up for a vote this week and please do all you can to make sure the Davis-Oliver Act receives one as well.
