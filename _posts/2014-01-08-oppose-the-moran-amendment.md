Please oppose the Moran amendment, number 2612, to the unemployment extension legislation. This amendment would take jobs away from Americans, not help jobless Americans.

I am disturbed that legislation that actually keeps Americans from finding work is seriously being considered as an amendment to the unemployment extension bill. 20 million Americans cannot find a job, including many in the STEM fields. It is simply a myth that America needs more STEM workers --- especially 125,000 more per yearâ€“ as the amendment would allow.

Former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan understood that increasing skilled immigration would harm American workers:

"Our skilled wages are higher than anywhere in the world. If we open up a significant window for skilled workers, that would suppress the skilled-wage level and end the concentration of income."

I urge you to oppose this amendment. It can only harm American workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
