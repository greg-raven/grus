It's striking to see how the hysteria about "global warming" has ramped up in the last month or so. Since the big push to implement the Kyoto Protocol world-wide, I have had the impression that this was yet another attempt to transition to a one-world government. Today, we see in this article in the San Diego Tribune (https://www.signonsandiego.com/news/world/20070201-1047-france-us-carbontax.html), another aspect of this attempt. Control gives the ability to tax, and tax dollars enable more control --- if by no other means than going after those who don't pay the tax.

There is no evidence that man has more than an insignificant effect on "global warming," and there is scant evidence that the mild warming trend we see is anything but natural and normal. By the way, President Clinton signed the Kyoto Protocol, but the U.S. Senate voted 97-0 not to ratify. It is left to the reader to determine who among our current liberal leaders was in the Senate at that time.

We can only hope that this goes the way of the U.N. efforts to tax international money transfers, and take over the Internet.
