I am writing to you today to DEMAND that you withdraw the outrageous H.R. 130, which would put government bureaucrats in charge of how my defensive arms are stored.

It is nobodyâ€™s business how I choose to protect my family but my own, and I will not tolerate your brazen attempt at encouraging false reporting to prompt police investigation.

Therefore, I once again stand with Firearms Policy Coalition in DEMANDING that you withdraw H.R. 130!
