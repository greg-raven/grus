I am writing to you today to DEMAND that you withdraw the outrageous H.R. 130, which would put government bureaucrats in charge of how my defensive arms are stored.

It is nobody's business how I choose to protect my family but my own, and I will not tolerate your brazen attempt at encouraging false reporting to prompt police investigation.

Therefore, I once again stand with Firearms Policy Coalition in DEMANDING that you withdraw H.R. 130!
