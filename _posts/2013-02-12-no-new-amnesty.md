I oppose the Senate Gang of Eight’s amnesty proposal to legalize millions of illegal immigrants.  
  
Combined with current laws, the legalization would be a pathway to massive new welfare expenditures, job competition, chain migration, and more illegal immigration.

1. It would cost trillions of dollars in extra government spending on social services.
2. It would immediately put millions of illegal aliens in front of the employment line to hold or take U.S. jobs while 20 million Americans who want a full-time job can’t find one.
3. It would allow amnestied aliens to begin endless chains of relatives to come and add further competition for jobs and government resources.
4. It would immediately legalize 11 million illegal aliens without requiring triggers that fully implement enforcement first. The previous seven amnesties between 1986 and 2000 had no enforcement triggers and served only to entice 11 million new illegal immigrants who now demand their own amnesty.

Sincerely,

Greg Raven
