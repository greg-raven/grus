“National Field Marshal for the New Black Panthers King Samir Shabazz who was caught on video tape allegedly intimidating voters in Philadelphia in 08 is now in charge of the New Black Panthers plan to create inner city militaries that would go into nurseries and kill white babies and murder white people n the street.”

So, you may be wondering when Caliph Hussein and/or Eric Holder is going to do something to stop what seems to be the threat of certain violence. Perhaps Caliph Hussein is content with reflecting that if he had a son, he would look like Shabazz.

Or, you may be wondering how Shabazz obtains weapons, and why he is allowed to keep them. If Shabazz is insane, then he shouldn’t have any weapons, right? If he’s NOT insane, then these must be considered serious threats. Apparently, progressive gun control is aimed only at law-abiding citizens who do not intend to harm anyone.
