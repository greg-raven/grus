I hope you will take the opportunity in these final days before the election to tell voters you'll change your tune and make border control and interior enforcement a priority.

I will find it difficult to vote for you because of your support for extremely high legal and illegal immigration and government-forced massive population growth.

Your immigration voting record, as tracked on www.Congressgrades.org, suggests that you do not vote to protect your constituents from increased flows of foreign workers and mass immigration.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
