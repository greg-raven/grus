The border crisis has gone on for long enough. For more than 24 months, Border Patrol agents have made at least 125,000 apprehensions at the Southern border — nearly 4 times the average number of apprehensions during Pres. Obama’s 8 years in office.

I urge you and your administration to reinstate the successful Remain in Mexico policy. The policy requires illegal border crossers to remain in Mexico until their appearance before an immigration judge. Preventing them from staying in the U.S. takes away the one thing all illegal border crossers look for — the chance to stay in the United States. By taking that incentive away, illegal migrants will stop coming.

Your lack of effective action puts American lives at risk every day. It’s time your administration finally took effective action to end the border crisis by reinstating the Remain in Mexico policy.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. Make E-Verify mandatory.
