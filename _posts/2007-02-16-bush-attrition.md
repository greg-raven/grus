Please consult with Rep. Steve King about his Attrition Through Enforcement solution to illegal immigration. 

When it comes to illegal immigration, it is wrong to say that the only choices we have are to either round up and deport all the illegal aliens or to reward them with amnesty. 

In fact, there is a third way that is practical and far cheaper. It is the Attrition Through Enforcement solution that provides for the third way of steadily bolstering enforcement at the border, at the workplace and in local communities that will result in illegal aliens paying their own way to return home. Rep. King outlined this clearly in recent Washington Times column. 

It won't happen all at once. But it already is happening today with hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens every year deciding to go home. I hope you'll consult with Rep. King and get behind Attrition Through Enforcement.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
