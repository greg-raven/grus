I ask that you withdraw H.R. 127.

I stand with millions of gun owners across the country in firm opposition to this bill, which you have proposed.

Your legislation is a disgusting violation of the U.S. Constitution and an infringement on my fundamental right to keep and bear arms. It puts bureaucratic officials in charge of whether I can exercise my inalienable right of self defense. And I will not stand idly by while this proposal seeks to destroy basic liberty.

Therefore, I ask that you immediately withdraw this treasonous bill!
