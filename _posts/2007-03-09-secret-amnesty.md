Please don't be fooled into thinking that a plan to reward illegal aliens with jobs and residency, even if they leave the country, is anything other than amnesty.

I have heard about the constant meetings at the White House to sell Members of Congress on your new amnesty plan and I am very disappointed. 

Please remember that a "step-out-step-in" provision in no way should ever qualify an illegal alien for a path to U.S. citizenship. Simply having to leave the country for a short time before returning to claim a job and legal status is still an amnesty. 

No matter how many steps and provisions are created, anything that allows an illegal alien to remain in this country indefinitely or permanently is an amnesty and will be opposed by the majority of voters. 

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction. Get our troops out of the Middle East and put them on the border, if that's what it takes get the illegals out and keep them out.
