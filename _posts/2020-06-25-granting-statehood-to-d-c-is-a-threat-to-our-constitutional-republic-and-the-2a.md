Vote NO on H.R. 51 — a bill that will violate the Constitution and permanently add two anti-gun Senators in the Congress.

As a voter, I oppose statehood for Washington D.C. in all forms. No city in this country should be able to have two senators in the United States Senate.

The Washington, D.C. Admissions Act is not altruistic and patriotic legislation “giving the District the same constitutional rights and authorities that the nation’s 50 states have had since 1789” as Congressman Hoyer would have you believe.

Indeed, admitting Washington D.C. is a partisan ploy to influence the number of Democratic votes in the United States Senate. Our country would never be the same if you were to thoughtlessly comply and guarantee an additional two Senate votes to the Democrat party.

I agree with Gun Owners of America that there will be huge political ramifications, such as the diminishment and even destruction of the Second Amendment.

Obey Article 1, Section 8, Clause 17 of our Constitution, vote against H.R. 51 — the Washington, D.C. Admissions Act — and protect our constitutional republic.
