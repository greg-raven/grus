I’m sending you a copy of this from the *Chicago Tribune,* April 21, 1934:

<figure class="wp-block-image">[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8aN4krk1nsk/Se-FtRPEBzI/AAAAAAAAALA/lehbZI5PFIo/s400/redredred.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_8aN4krk1nsk/Se-FtRPEBzI/AAAAAAAAALA/lehbZI5PFIo/s1600-h/redredred.jpg)</figure>> Title: “Planned economy or planned destruction?”
> 
> Driving the wagon: “Tugwell Head Brain Trust”
> 
> In the wagon: “You pinkies from Columbia and Harvard” (drinking from a bottle labeled “Power”)
> 
> Written on the back of the wagon: “Depleting the resources of the soundest government in the world.”
> 
> Trotsky writes: “Plan of Action for U.S.: Spend! Spend! Spend!; Under the guise of recovering — bust the government — blame the capitalists for the failure — junk the Constitution and declare a dictatorship.”
> 
> Stalin says: “How red the sunrise is getting.”
> 
> Side note: “It worked in Russia!”
