Title: "Planned economy or planned destruction?"
>
> Driving the wagon: "Tugwell Head Brain Trust"
>
> In the wagon: "You pinkies from Columbia and Harvard" (drinking from a bottle labeled "Power")
>
> Written on the back of the wagon: "Depleting the resources of the soundest government in the world."
>
> Trotsky writes: "Plan of Action for U.S.: Spend! Spend! Spend!; Under the guise of recovering --- bust the government --- blame the capitalists for the failure --- junk the Constitution and declare a dictatorship."
>
> Stalin says: "How red the sunrise is getting."
>
> Side note: "It worked in Russia!"
