Thank you for endorsing national concealed carry reciprocity during your campaign. But now Michael Bloomberg is plotting to kill S. 446 and H.R. 38 by splitting Republicans with a $25 million campaign utilizing fake activists and fake news.

A Statement of Administration Policy in support of S. 446 and H.R. 38 would be a powerful message that would unite Republicans and help finally push national concealed carry through Congress.

As a supporter of the Second Amendment, I encourage you to immediately issue this Statement. I, and the millions of other supporters of the Second Amendment, appreciate your action on this matter and thank you in advance.

Sincerely,

Greg Raven, Apple Valley, CA
