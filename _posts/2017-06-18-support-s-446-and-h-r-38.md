Thank you for endorsing national concealed carry reciprocity during your campaign. But now Michael Bloomberg is plotting to kill S. 446 and H.R. 38 by splitting Republicans with a $25 million campaign utilizing fake activists and fake news.

A Statement of Administration Policy in support of S. 446 and H.R. 38 would be a powerful message that would unite Republicans and help finally push national concealed carry through Congress.

As a supporter of the Second Amendment, I encourage you to immediately issue this Statement. I, and the millions of other supporters of the Second Amendment, appreciate your action on this matter and thank you in advance.
