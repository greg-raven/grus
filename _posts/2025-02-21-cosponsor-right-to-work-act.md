While we secure our borders, let's also secure the workplace! Congressman Ken Calvert (CA-41) has introduced bipartisan H.R. 251, The Legal Workforce Act.

This bill would mandate E-Verify to help ensure that American jobs go to only people legally authorized to work here. E-Verify is the most effective tool to discourage future illegal immigration and encourage illegal workers (including those who arrived during the 2021-2024 surge) to return to their home countries.

It is crucial that you cosponsor the Legal Workforce Act.
