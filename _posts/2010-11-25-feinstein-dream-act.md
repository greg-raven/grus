I truly am disappointed, and more than a little shocked, that you have decided to support the DREAM Act amnesty. I would have thought that, given the recent election, you would be looking ahead to 2012 and would be opposing, not supporting, an anti-American amnesty bill.

Size, scope, and lack of credibility are all reasons to vote against the DREAM Act should Sen. Reid force the bill to the floor during the lame duck session of Congress.

The American people have great sympathy for illegal alien children who know no other country as home, but the DREAM Act would give eventual citizenship to young adults who have spent very little of their lives in the United States. DREAM amnesty recipients can then sponsor adult relatives of their extended family, including the people who initially smuggled them into the U.S.

Anyone under the age of 35 is eligible, and applicants merely have to claim that they meet the eligibility, since the burden of proof would lie with DHS, not the applicants. This is a recipe for fraud that has national security implications as well.

The DREAM Act was originally written almost a decade ago and has changed very little in that time. Those of us who have sympathy for many illegal aliens who are here through no fault of their own deserve and demand a better bill; one that would include mandatory workplace verification to ensure that other parent's won't be tempted to make the same mistake these kids' parents did; and one that prevents the parents who created this terrible situation for their children to benefit from it.

Simply put, the DREAM Act is a very poorly written bill that would do far more harm than good. If you support this bill and help keep millions of American workers out of a job, you can forget about winning reelection in 2012.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. I don't understand why you liberals hate the United States so much. You disgust me.
