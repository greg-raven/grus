As a taxpaying citizen, I'm fed up with lawmakers and policymakers who are pushing our nation to the brink of bankruptcy with the greatest deficit spending and most burdensome bailouts in history. This means you! These insane, failed policies only prolong the agony and double the burden for our children and grandchildren for generations to come.

I'm putting you on notice and holding you accountable not only for my financial future, but for that of my nation. Furthermore, I want you to know that I oppose:

- The "too-big-to-fail" bailouts that can only deepen the crisis and postpone a real recovery;
- The huge tax increases and massive government borrowing that would inevitably be needed to fund the largest federal deficits of all time; and
- The "punish the innocent and reward the guilty" path our leaders are stubbornly pursuing --- a path that will surely dash the American Dream.

As an American, I am committed to exposing your failing plan and taking back my nation from the brink of economic destruction.
