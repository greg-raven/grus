A few years back, we were told that non-white minorities were not being granted access to credit to buy homes the way whites were. The solution was to mandate that lenders give loans to non-whites.  
  
Now, a huge percentage of those loans have come a cropper. The reason, we’re told, is that for the last few years lenders have targeted non-white minorities in marketing risky loans.

Clearly, the solution is NOT to go back to the way things were, but rather, to give more to non-white minorities, using money stolen through taxation and inflation from whites. When is it ever going to be enough?

How about this: On the birth of any non-white in the U.S., give the infant $100,000, a high school diploma, a college degree, a house, a car, welfare, Medicare, food stamps, a cell phone, and an iPod. Would that do it, or should we throw in some “bling?”
