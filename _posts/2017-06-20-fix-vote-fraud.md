As a candidate, you made references to vote fraud as a serious issue in the United States. I agree, which is why I applauded your executive order establishing a commission to investigate vote fraud.

However, there is an easy solution that severely limits the possibility of vote fraud in the first place, along with the need for commissions, studies, committees, and any more bureaucracy.

Simply put, have everyone re-register to vote before each election.

Obviously, you retain previous vote registrations for reference, but having everyone re-register for each election should virtually eliminate duplicates, people who have moved without "de-registering," fraud, etc.

Please don't hesitate to contact me if you wish to discuss this.
