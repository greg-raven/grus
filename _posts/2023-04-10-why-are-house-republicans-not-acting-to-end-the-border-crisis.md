I cannot understand why some House Republicans are preventing House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jordan from moving forward with a hearing to pass a package of border security bills. According to news reports, the hearings have now been delayed until after the Easter break. Why the delay?

Resident Biden's border crisis shows no signs of abating and the Republican-led House must pass legislation to stop it.

Please encourage your party's leaders to allow legislation to bring the situation at the U.S.-Mexico border under control to move forward. And to truly fix the crisis, this legislation must include measures to mandate use of the E-Verify system and to end asylum fraud and abuse.
