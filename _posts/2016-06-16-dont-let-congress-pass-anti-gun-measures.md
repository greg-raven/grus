As your constituent, I am writing you today to urge you to oppose any and all gun control legislation that may be considered in the wake of the terrorist attack in Orlando.

Anti-gun elected officials are using this tragedy as an excuse to pass and promote their gun control agenda. The anti-gun proposals include: the reinstatement of the failed federal ban on semi-automatic firearms; increased federal funding of gun control research; a policy to use secret government lists to deny Second Amendment rights; and the creation of federal registration scheme.

While I do not condone the heinous acts that occurred in Orlando, this knee-jerk reaction by anti-gun legislators will only infringe on the ability of law-abiding citizens to exercise their right to self-defense.

Please stand up for our Second Amendment rights and reject any and all calls for new gun control legislation.

Thank you, and I await your response on this important issue.
