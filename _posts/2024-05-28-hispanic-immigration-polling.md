Hispanic voters favor slower immigration-driven population growth. Largely, they think our country is not doing enough to stop illegal immigration.

In a poll of likely voters conducted by the Rasmussen Reports Immigration Index, 70% of Hispanic voters responded that the government is doing too little to reduce illegal border crossings and visa overstays.

Please contact me to discuss ways that you and other members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus can work to address Hispanic voters' concerns about illegal immigration.
