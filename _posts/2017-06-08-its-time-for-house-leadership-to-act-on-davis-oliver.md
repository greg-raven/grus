A few weeks ago, the House Judiciary Committee has approved H.R. 2431, the Davis-Oliver Act, that would strengthen interior enforcement. This critical piece of legislation is badly needed to ensure that the Executive Branch upholds its duty to enforce federal immigration laws.

The Davis-Oliver Act would strengthen existing immigration enforcement and further empower states and localities to enforce immigration law.

While delivering a campaign speech on immigration last August, President Trump said passing the Davis-Oliver Act was one of his top priorities on immigration.

The House Judiciary Committee has done its job. It's now time for House Leadership to bring this legislation to the floor for a vote.
