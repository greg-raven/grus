News reports are saying that evangelical leaders have been lobbying Republican Congressmen in favor of work permits and other benefits for illegal aliens. I hope you have heard about the new poll showing that the vast majority of evangelical Christians oppose Speaker John Boehner's immigration proposals to reward illegal aliens with work permits and legal status. Please follow the immigration opinions of evangelicals --- not evangelical leaders --- as they happen to match my own.

According to the *Washington Examiner,* the poll says that:

> "Most evangelicals, 73 percent, said that, instead of bringing in more immigrant workers, employers should be 'required to try harder to recruit and train Americans from those high-unemployment groups. And most evangelicals, 68 percent, said they are willing to pay higher prices if it is necessary for employers to raise wages to fill jobs with Americans instead of adding more foreign workers."

I agree with these sentiments and agree with the immigration views of evangelical Christians. I sincerely hope you will support legislation that matches these views.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
