- Pass necessary funding to revoke Biden's border surge

Please approve a budget that provides for immigration enforcement measures to pursue goals that voters overwhelmingly desire: a secure border and removal of the millions of illegal and other uninvited foreign workers who arrived during the Biden border surge.

Mass immigration was the decisive factor in the 2024 election. Voters were very clear that the record levels of immigration over the past few years were unsustainable and irresponsible.

It is only common sense that, after the worst border crisis in U.S. history, Congress must pass historic levels of funding for border security and interior enforcement.
