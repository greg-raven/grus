Please support PLCAA protections for our firearms industries.

I urge you to support and defend the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act (PLCAA). Vote no on (H.R. 2814/S. 1338)!

Anti-Second Amendment advocates want to gun PLCAA so that they can use aggressive lawfare to sue firearms and accessory manufacturers into bankruptcy.

This is an attack on the liberty and property of American gun owners by trying to strangle the supply chain. In no sane world is a business responsible for the criminal misuse of their product.

I urge you in the strongest terms to support the PLCAA. Vote no on (H.R. 2814/S. 1338)!
