It is disappointing that you voted against the motions to invoke cloture on S. 3100 and S. 2193. The bills would have stopped sanctuary cities from shielding criminal aliens and would have saved Americans’ lives. I cannot understand you willingness to protect illegal aliens at the expense of innocent Americans.

A recent Senate hearing into sanctuary localities hosted Laura Wilkerson, whose son Josh was beaten, tortured, and burned to death by an illegal alien. During the hearing, she said:

“I don’t want your sympathy. I want you to do something about it.”

Why won’t you do something about it? Why won’t you vote to prevent innocent individuals from being murdered by criminal illegal aliens? Countless Americans have died because sanctuary localities refused to hand criminal illegal aliens over to federal authorities. Is it really more important to allow criminal illegal aliens to remain in the United States than to prevent Americans from being murdered? I hope you will come to the conclusion that it is not.

Your votes against S. 3100 and S. 2193 defy reason. I urge you to reconsider your stance on sanctuary cities.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Sanctuary cities threaten American lives, and yet, you have voted to protect these bastions of crime, violence and danger from the law.
