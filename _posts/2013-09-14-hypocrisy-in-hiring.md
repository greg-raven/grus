I was sickened to learn that companies that have laid off thousands of American workers are now asking Congress to increase the number of foreign workers they are able to hire. I hope you will not accede to their demands and will work to protect American workers. Please read the attached article about their efforts.

> On Tuesday, the chief human resources officers of more than 100 large corporations sent a letter to House Speaker John Boehner and Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi urging quick passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill.
>
> The officials represent companies with a vast array of business interests: General Electric, The Walt Disney Company, Marriott International, Hilton Worldwide, Hyatt Hotels Corporation, McDonald's Corporation, The Wendy's Company, Coca-Cola, The Cheesecake Factory, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Verizon Communications, Hewlett-Packard, General Mills, and many more. All want to see increases in immigration levels for low-skill as well as high-skill workers, in addition to a path to citizenship for the millions of immigrants currently in the U.S. illegally.

P.S. Stop all immigration, evict the illegals (including "anchor babies") who are already here, and return to pre-1965 immigration rules!
