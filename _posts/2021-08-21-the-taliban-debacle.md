I can understand Americans being upset about recent developments in Afghanistan, but I cannot understand the surprise expressed by many.

Arming and funding the mujahideen (who would later become the Taliban, Al Qaeda, and the Muslim Brotherhood) started under President Carter in the 1970s. Among the mujahideen was Osama bin Laden. President Reagan stepped up funding in 1981, and CIA paramilitary officers trained the mujahideen in many tactics such as car bombs, assassinations, and other acts that are now classified as terrorism.

It is worth noting the extent to which the CIA, FBI, and NSA have acted to protect members of al Qaeda in the past --- starting with the 1987 founding of al-Kifah Refugee Center in Brooklyn, a hub for U.S.-based mujahideen --- including Omar Abdel-Rahman (the Egyptian "blind sheik"), Ali Mohamed (an Egyptian with many connections to both the CIA and FBI), accused murdered El Sayyid Nosair, Essam Hafez Marzouk (a close ally of Ayman al-Zawahiri and Osama bin Laden), and Emad Salem (an "FBI informant" who appears to have been a key player in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center). This protection extended to cover involvement in the 1993 bombing of the World Trade Center, the 1998 bombing of the U.S. embassy in Kenya, and the 2001 attacks on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.

The U.S. also moved against secular strongmen such as Saddam Hussein and Muammar al-Qaddafi to the benefit of radical Islam. Although each suppressed militant Islamic factions while in power, this fell afoul of U.S. / globalist interests. President George W. Bush deposed Hussein using the invasion of Kuwait and phantasmagorical "weapons of mass destruction" as fig leafs. President Barack Obama --- who had members of the Muslim Brotherhood in his administration --- overthrew Muammar al-Qaddafi in Libya with the help and support of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. This resulted in huge quantities of arms falling into the hands of the Muslim Brotherhood.

The 9/11 attacks also happened during the Bush presidency. After quietly complying with bin Laden's three main demands, the U.S. spent the next ten years occupying Afghanistan on the pretext of hunting for Osama bin Laden, while spending untold billions building mosques and infrastructure, and scolding us not to blame Muslims for an attack carried out by Muslims in the name of Islam. For the ten years after finding and eliminating bin Laden, America stayed in Afghanistan and spent even more billions on infrastructure projects. Other *sub rosa* actions included tasking the U.S. military with protecting Afghan opium poppy farmers, despite the ongoing War On Drugs on the home front.

President Obama and successor Secretary of State John Kerry subsequently turned over billions to the Islamic state of Iran, one of the leading countries of state-sponsored terrorism. Kerry would later visit Iran illegally to advise them on how best to stand up to President Donald Trump. When four Muslim men who had been hired by Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz and other members of the U.S. House of Representatives to perform IT duties instead committed numerous crimes, Reps. Nancy Pelosi and Paul Ryan provided cover for them until they were out of the country and safely beyond the arm of U.S. justice.

Against this background, President Joe Biden's monumental fumble withdrawing U.S. troops from Afghanistan is merely the latest episode of America turning over untold riches and weaponry to Islamic warriors, along with perhaps the greatest recruiting tool any organization could imagine. No longer is there any reason for Muslims not to believe they are doing God's work in fighting America (which they call the Great Satan) and converting the rest of the world to Islam.
