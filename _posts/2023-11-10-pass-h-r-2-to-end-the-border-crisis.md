I cannot understand why Congress is considering a massive "border security" funding bill that does not include significant policy changes. Additional supplemental funding will not solve the border crisis, it will just make it easier for the Biden administration to manage the crisis its failed policies have created. This additional funding is intended to allow them to manage the situation better by processing illegal economic migrants more quickly so they can be released into the U.S. in higher numbers. Unfortunately, allowing illegal aliens to enter the U.S. more quickly will only exacerbate the problem by encouraging more illegal economic migrants to cross the border and make fraudulent asylum claims.

The best way to end the border crisis is to change the underlying policy. The House-passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, would make these changes and finally end the crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border.

Every policy change enacted by the White House has led to an increase in illegal immigration and an increase of the chaos at the U.S. / Mexico border. Please pass H.R. 2 to end the chaos and restore sanity and legality to our immigration system.
