I find it appalling that you would even consider cosponsoring Harry Reid's S. 9!

More then 11 million Americans are looking for a job. This means America's unemployment rate is 7.2% --- the highest in 16 years. Worse still, America's economy eliminated more jobs than any year since 1945. It is clear that Congress must act to help American workers.

However, rather than help American workers, you have decided to harm them. S. 9 could import millions of foreign workers at a time when American workers desperately need jobs. Are the wishes of your corporate and special interest friends more important than the needs of your constituents?

I urge you to look deep inside yourself and determine if you can really support legislation that would harm millions of American workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
