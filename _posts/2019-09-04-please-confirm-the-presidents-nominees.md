As a FreedomWorks activist I’m urging you to confirm President Trump’s conservative nominees.

I understand that right before your August Recess the Senate confirmed just 13 of the president’s judicial nominees and dozens of others.

And while I’m happy that they were confirmed, I’m incredibly frustrated that it’s taking so long to get good people confirmed.

Instead of waiting until the last minute before a vacation, I’m asking you and your Senate colleagues to stay in session a little bit longer each week and confirm these well-qualified nominees.
