Gallup has released a new poll showing that a plurality of Americans want to reduce immigration numbers. 41% of Americans want to reduce immigration numbers, while only 22% of Americans want to increase immigration.

A study by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that while the number of native-born Americans has grown significantly since 2000, the number in the workforce has declined by 127,000. However, the number of legal immigrants and illegal aliens holding a job has increased by 5.7 million in the same time period.

Furthermore, despite the faltering economy and unemployment increasing, between 2008 and the start of 2014, 6.5 million legal immigration and illegal aliens settled in the U.S. and 3 million of those found jobs.

Why should immigration numbers be so high when American workers simply cannot find jobs? I urge you to look at the numbers and listen to the will of the American people. Please work to reduce immigration numbers.
