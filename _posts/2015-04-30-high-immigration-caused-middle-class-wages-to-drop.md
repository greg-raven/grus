The Congressional Research Service has tied falling middle class wages to increased immigration numbers and Congress has done nothing to address this very serious problem. Reducing immigration numbers to sensible levels would increase middle class wages and I urge you to push for legislation that would make this happen.

With more than 1.5 million new foreign workers coming to the United States each year, it’s no wonder that immigration is having such a marked impact on middle class wages. When President Obama’s desire to amnesty 10-18 million illegal aliens and give them work permits is taken into account, American workers are in grave danger.

The CRS study is clear, the increased immigration of the past decades has severely harmed middle class Americans and brought their wages down to 1970s levels. This is unacceptable and needs to be addressed while America has a middle class to save.

Please do all you can to pass legislation that brings down immigration numbers. The American people are suffering and need your help.
