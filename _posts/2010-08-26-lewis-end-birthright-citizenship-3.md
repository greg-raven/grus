I see the problem of anchor babies as a serious flaw in our immigration law. I am asking you to cosponsor H.R. 1868.

As a matter of policy for decades, the Federal government has granted citizenship to babies born to illegal alien mothers. This is a pronounced reward to those parents who have entered or stayed in the United States in violation of immigration laws.

Not only do the mothers immediately get access to a whole array taxpayer-funded social services for their babies, but these illegal aliens get a virtual guarantee that they will never be asked to leave the country.

I am counting on you to support H.R. 1868 to address this important issue. I look forward to hearing from you soon.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. There is nothing in our laws that allows "anchor babies," a loophole used by those who would destroy this country. We must close this loophole explicitly if we hope ever to get our country back.
