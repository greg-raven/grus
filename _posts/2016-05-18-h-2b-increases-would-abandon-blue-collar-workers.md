Sen. Jeff Sessions has written to the Senate Appropriations Committee urging them to oppose efforts to quadruple H-2B visa numbers to 264,000. I urge you to read his letter and do all you can to support jobless Americans by opposing this massive increase in foreign workers.

Sen. Sessions said in a letter to the Senate Appropriations Committee:

> "Blue-collar American workers have long endured an excess of foreign workers. Millions of foreign workers have been brought to the United States, while countless jobs have gone overseas. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the total labor force participation is 62.8 percent; the rate for those with less than a high school diploma, 46.6 percent; and, for those with a high school diploma or the equivalent, 57.2 percent. The unemployment rate for those with less than a high school diploma is 8.4 percent, with 967,000 unemployed and seeking work. The unemployment rate for those with a high school diploma or the equivalent is 5.2 percent, with 1,853,000 unemployed and seeking work. And these statistics do not reflect the number of those workers who are currently underemployed."

I know you care just as much about these Americans as Sen. Sessions does. I hope you will work with him to oppose all efforts to increase H-2B numbers as part of the FY2017 DHS appropriations bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
