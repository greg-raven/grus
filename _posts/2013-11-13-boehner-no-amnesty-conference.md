I wanted to let you know that House Speaker Boehner just said that he has no intention of conferencing any legislation with the Senate's "Gang of Eight" amnesty. Please make sure no other amnesty or immigration legislation that harms American workers is passed by the House.

It is good that Speaker Boehner finally has stuck up for American workers when so many have turned their backs on us. The last six years have seen enormous levels of unemployment and labor participation rates are at all time lows. 20 million Americans want a full-time job but can't find one. Despite this, the Senate passed legislation that would add 33 million additional foreign workers over the next decade. Whomever the Senate listened to before passing their amnesty, it wasn't jobless Americans.

The House of Representatives must listen to American workers and must understand that legislation that amnesties illegal aliens or makes it harder for Americans to find work cannot be passed. Please work hard to make sure this does not happen.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. This is only one step toward undoing the destruction to our economy caused by Barack Obama, but it is an important one. We must keep pushing in this direction.
