I hope you and your colleagues don't buy the misleading border apprehension statistics the administration peddling. While the administration likes to tout statistics showing apprehensions are down, these do not tell the whole story: illegal aliens who turn themselves in and request asylum at ports of entry are not counted as "apprehensions." To make matters worse, these illegal aliens are then given work permits and allowed to move throughout the United States until their hearing dates (which will be scheduled several years later).

It is unconscionable that the administration is playing this shell game with our nation's security and using the broken asylum system to do it. Most illegal border crossers are nothing more than illegal economic migrants who have been taught by the administration to game the asylum system to receive work permits and protected status.

I hope you will support efforts to reinstate the Migration Protection Protocols so that asylum seekers are required to remain in a safe third country while their applications are processed. Until this is done and our asylum system is fixed, true border security can never be achieved.
