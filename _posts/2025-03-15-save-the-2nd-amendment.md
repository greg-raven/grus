Here are three critical actions I hope you take to save the Second Amendment.

I understand that the Attorney General's report on how to save the Second Amendment is almost due.

Here are the TOP THREE action items I expect to see included:

1. Abolishing the ATF's illegal gun registry

2. Repealing the Frame and Receiver rule that restricts your right to make homemade firearms

3. Holding ATF & FBI officials accountable for exceeding the law to violate the 2A rights of law-abiding Americans

Not only is a federal gun registry simply unconstitutional on its own, but it can also be used as a weapon for tyrants to confiscate guns.

Additionally, it's imperative that the Trump Administration withdraw the Frame and Receiver Rule immediately, which was set in place by the Biden-Harris Administration to wage war on so-called "ghost guns" by restricting a person's right to make their own firearm. This rule also establishes that every 4473 form will eventually get sent to the ATF.

Finally, the ATF has operated as a rogue criminal organization that bypasses Congress, tramples on the Constitution, and will gladly resort to violence to assert its power. And the FBI is certainly guilty of preying upon gun-owning Americans as well.

I'm including clear instances in which the ATF and FBI have exceeded the law to violate Americans' Second Amendment rights:

- ATF agents killing a gun owner named Bryan Malinowski in his own home – while "forgetting" to wear their body cameras and covering Bryan's doorbell camera with tape

- ATF spying on pro-gun message boards to create lists of law-abiding gun owners who purchase guns legally through private sellers—which is an activity that ATF considers outside the law 
 
- ATF spying and registering gun owners by using facial recognition technology

- ATF illegally shutting down gun dealers for mere clerical errors through Biden's Zero Tolerance policy
 
- The FBI coercing law-abiding gun owners to sign away their right to purchase firearms

- ATF stealing from taxpayers by illegally overpaying its agents and stealing firearms for personal use

ATF and FBI officials must be held accountable for exceeding the law to violate the God-given rights of gun owners.

These three actions absolutely MUST be included in the final 2A report --- and Gun Owners of America will certainly inform me if they make it in.
