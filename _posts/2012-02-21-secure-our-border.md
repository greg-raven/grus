To say I am disturbed by the video of drug smugglers sneaking into the United States using an automotive jack is putting it mildly. To be honest, I'm in an apoplectic fury. Everyone who has said that our border is secure has been lying and the proof is in the video.

Ask yourself the best way the government can spend $1 billion. It could improve the education of hundreds of thousands of school children. It could improve the medical care and rehabilitation of wounded soldiers and veterans. Or, it could build the world's longest garage door, operated using automotive jacks ([you can view its use here](https://youtu.be/Qdc-kv7nzaU?si=LZkFuqfrWoM1iLTi)). Need I even ask you what our government decided to spend the money on?

Anyone in Washington or elsewhere who says our border is secure is either deluded or a politician. Everyday, drugs and illegal aliens (or drug-laden illegal aliens) come across our borders and make our nation less safe. Boeing was paid more than $1 billion to prevent this from occurring. The video makes it look like they took American taxpayer dollars and laughed all the way to the bank.

What you and your colleagues in Congress must do is clear. First, you must ensure that Boeing fixes the present fence so that it actually keeps people out, rather than provide them with easy entry. And second, you must make sure that a proper triple-fence is built so that it is near-impossible for anyone to come into the U.S. illegally.

Americans have been let down on this issue. Please make sure we're not let down again.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
