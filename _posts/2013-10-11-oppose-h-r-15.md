The Democrats just released their amnesty bill, H.R. 15, and made it clear that they want all illegal aliens to receive an amnesty, work permits, and taxpayer-provided subsidies. I hope you will oppose this attempt to force a "Gang of Eight"-like bill through the House and oppose all attempts to have a vote on immigration bills while the Senate amnesty bill is still pending.  
  
It's a pity that the House Democrats did not listen to their Senate colleague, Bernie Sanders, when he talked about the Senate amnesty:

> "What I absolutely do not want to see is immigration legislation which would bring low-wage workers into the United States that would take jobs away from American workers.... Don't tell me that we don't have people who can make beds in the United States, who live in the U.S., who don't want those jobs."

Sadly, it seems that the Democrats in the House believe that the 20 million Americans without a full-time job do not deserve full-time jobs. However, they do believe that the 11-18 million illegal aliens living in the U.S. do deserve work permits and jobs.

I hope you will not take this bill seriously, but will take the threat of an amnesty seriously. Those supporting amnesty want the House to pass any immigration legislation so that it can be combined with the Senate's "Gang of Eight" amnesty and forced on the American people. Don't let this happen; don't allow any votes on immigration bills while S. 744 is still pending.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
