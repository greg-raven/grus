With Vice President Kamala Harris now the Democratic nominee, it's important to look back at her attempts to end illegal immigration. In March 2021, the White House dispatched Vice President Harris to Mexico and the Northern Triangle countries to tackle migration "challenges" and the "root causes" of illegal immigration. Unfortunately, her "Migration Strategy" to end illegal immigration has been a resounding failure and already-high illegal immigration has ballooned into the current Biden-Harris border crisis.

The Biden-Harris solution to the border crisis has failed. What is needed is H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. This legislation, if passed, would:

- plug the loopholes in our asylum system that are exploited by illegal economic migrants, restoring its integrity and protecting it for legitimate asylum seekers;

- block the Biden administration from continuing its policies of catch-and-release, thus deterring future waves of illegal migrants;

- put a stop to the surges of family units and unaccompanied alien children, protecting them from exploitation and victimization by the cartels and traffickers;

- put teeth into efforts to deter visa overstays;

- rein in the breathtaking and illegal abuse of parole; and

- institute mandatory nationwide E-Verify, which would shut off the "jobs magnet" for illegal immigration while protecting jobs for American workers.

Please help end the border crisis by supporting a solution that works; get H.R. 2 passed to secure the border and stop illegal immigration.

Sincerely,
