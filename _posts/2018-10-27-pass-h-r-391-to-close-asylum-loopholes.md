The 5,000-strong caravan of illegal Honduran migrants aims to take advantage of a loophole in our immigration laws to cross the border. The Obama administration allowed asylum seekers to use a fear of crime or domestic abuse as a claim for asylum even though U.S. law clearly states that asylum seekers must have a fear of "persecution in their home country because of their race, religion, nationality, political opinion, or membership in a particular social group."

H.R. 391, the Asylum Reform and Border Protection Act, would close this loophole and prevent illegal economic migrants from taking advantage of our asylum laws by filing false claims.

I urge you to support this legislation and do all you can to get it passed!
