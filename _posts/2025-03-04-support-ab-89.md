I am writing to express my strong support for Assembly Bill 89, as it represents a vital step in protecting the integrity and fairness of girls sports in California.

This bill is essential in upholding womens rights and ensuring equitable competition in athletics. By amending California law to prohibit male-assigned individuals from participating in girls sports teams, A.B. 89 restores the balance and provides female athletes with the fair playing field they deserve.

Furthermore, I appreciate that A.B. 89 promotes inclusivity for all students in sex-segregated school programs while maintaining clear boundaries in competitive sports. This legislation not only champions the spirit of competition but also protects the unique opportunities afforded to young women athletes.

I urge you to continue championing Assembly Bill 89 and help safeguard the future of womens sports in our state.

Thank you for your attention to this important issue.
