More people means lower quality of life. Stop pushing population growth.

I do not support the narrative that unless our population endlessly grows, our country will fail. This is a farce being pushed by those who stand to profit economically and politically at great cost to the rest of us. Traffic and congestion, for example, are directly linked to population growth --- this is already a serious problem in our country that brings with it a myriad of issues. Unfortunately, traffic will not improve as long as we continue to add people and their cars to our population. Please be reasonable and understand that everything has a certain capacity before it starts to overflow, which is then not good for anyone or anything involved. Unless it's from the slot machine at the casino, but even that puts extra wear on the machine.
