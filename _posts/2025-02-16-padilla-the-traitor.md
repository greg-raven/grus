You truly are an idiot. As such, you do not represent me, and you do not represent the United States of America.

On taking office, you swore an oath of office:

>  I do solemnly swear that I will support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies, foreign and domestic; that I will bear true faith and allegiance to the same; that I take this obligation freely, without any mental reservation or purpose of evasion; and that I will well and faithfully discharge the duties of the office on which I am about to enter. So help me God.

As far as I can tell, you have utterly failed to uphold your oath in any meaningful way.

I just watched a video of a Senate hearing, in which you asked Kash Patel if he thought the Second Amendment gave the right to own machine guns to U.S. citizens. Obviously, U.S. citizens can and do own machine guns. If you were competent, you would know this. You would also know that the Second Amendment does not give rights, it merely confirms them, limiting the reach and power of the federal government.

Therefore, you, sir, are a domestic enemy of the United States. I demand that you immediately vacate your seat, retire from politics, renounce your citizenship, and move out of the country.
