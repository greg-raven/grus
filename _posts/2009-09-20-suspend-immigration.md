Another 12,300 jobs were lost in California last month. The unemployment rate is 12.2%! It is time for a suspension of most immigration at least until our state's unemployment gets back down below 5%.

I cannot for the life of me understand why this country continues to issue 100,000 green cards each month! The majority of these individuals do not have talents or abilities that Americans don't have. However, these individuals are allowed to permanently enter our country and compete against America's most vulnerable for a dwindling number of jobs. This shameless disregard for the plight of America's workers cannot be allowed to continue.

There needs to be legislation introduced in this Congress that would result in an immigration suspension --- excluding spouses, children, and extraordinarily talented workers; we simply do not need more foreign workers. Californians need your help. Please do the right thing and support legislation to temporarily suspend most forms of immigration.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. If you guys in Washington don't get this fixed, you could be the next to lose your jobs.
