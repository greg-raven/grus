Senators:

I believe you and your fellow Democrats should take note of a recent Rasmussen poll. It shows that union members are not fond of your party's immigration proposals.

Union members were asked: "Do you favor or oppose a proposal to provide a path to U.S. citizenship for illegal immigrants already in this country, penalize employers for hiring illegal immigrants and take other steps to secure the nation's borders?"

While 59% of all Americans supported the proposal, only 40% union members did, while 36% opposed. From these numbers, it's clear that union members are less-than-excited about your party's amnesty plans.

From the same Rasmussen poll, it was also shown that only 43% of union members think legalization is important and only 40% favor the Senate Group of Eight proposal.

Amnesty is bad for America and bad for American workers. I hope you will oppose any legislation that allows amnestied illegal aliens to compete against U.S. workers for U.S. jobs.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Mr. Greg Raven
