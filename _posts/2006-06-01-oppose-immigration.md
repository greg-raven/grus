The Senate immigration bill would be a disaster for American workers. I am counting on you to stand with the majority of Republican Senators and oppose it.

Americans want less overall immigration and less importation of foreign workers. S. 2611 provides for just the opposite. It would add 66 million foreign workers and their dependents over the next 20 years. 

A majority of Senate Republicans opposed the immigration increases of S. 2611 and H.R. 4437 contains no immigration increase. 

I'm counting on you to tell Speaker Hastert that you agree with him on not bringing anything to floor that the majority of GOP Representatives reject. I am part of that majority that fully rejects S. 2611.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. My wife and I are grateful to you for your efforts along these lines. Keep up the good work!
