Thank you for being such a positive force in fighting the forces that put Americans out of work and drive down U.S. wages (illegal immigration and foreign worker importation). Your good NumbersUSA Immigration-Reduction Grade proves you care about jobless Americans.

The last thing I want to do is to belittle your work or make it seem that I don't value the work you have done in the first-half of the 112th Congress. However, I do believe that you could have done more. NumbersUSA ranks more than 40 Republicans as having done more than you to help unemployed Americans to find jobs. These Republicans have cosponsored all sorts of bills, from mandatory E-Verify bills from bills to eliminate the visa lottery and chain migration. I sincerely hope you will review the records of these Representatives and cosponsor the immigration bills that they have introduced and cosponsored.

However, I do realize that no number of immigration cosponsorships will do a single thing unless Speaker Boehner allows the bills to receive a vote on the House floor. So, I am asking you to pressure the speaker to do this. He has an unfortunate habit of opposing pro-American worker immigration bills and this cannot be allowed to continue. Your pressure, and that of your confederates, can force the speaker to move on this issue. I am positive of it.

Thank you for your hard work in 2011 and please continue to look after America's workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
