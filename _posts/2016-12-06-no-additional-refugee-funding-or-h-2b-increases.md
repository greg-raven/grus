We hear that President Obama wants Congress to more than double refugee resettlement spending to $3.9 billion in the upcoming continuing resolution. We urge you to oppose this request and to oppose efforts to extend the provision exempting returning H-2B workers from the H-2B cap.

President Obama and his administration have consistently encouraged people, particularly unaccompanied minors, to come to the U.S. illegally. This massive influx has been facilitated by the president's refusal to allow the Border Patrol and USCIS to enforce the law. President Obama has created a situation where thousands of illegal aliens, many of them unaccompanied minors, continue to cross the border each day and it is up to the U.S. government to feed, house, and resettle them. The president and his wanton disregard of the law created this situation and it is not Congress' responsibility to spend taxpayers' money to get him and his administration out of it.

It is also disturbing that some Members of Congress continue to put the interests of billion-dollar businesses above the wellbeing of jobless Americans. Efforts to extend the provision exempting returning H-2B workers from the H-2B cap will put hundreds of thousands of Americans out of work as it has the capacity to quadruple the cap to 264,000 visas.

Please oppose any efforts to increase refugee resettlement spending from the current $1.7 billion per year and please make sure the continuing resolution doesn't extend the job-destroying quadrupling of H-2B numbers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. The people have spoken: No additional refugees and no additional immigration until we drain the swamp, figure out who is already here (and what they are doing), secure our border, and can vet newcomers. Our immigration system must serve American interests, not international interests or Obama's twisted agenda.
