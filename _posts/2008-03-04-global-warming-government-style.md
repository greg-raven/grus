With record snowfalls and freezing temperatures across the planet, this whole global warming thing is pretty pathetic. As they say, there is no problem sufficiently small that there exists a governmental solution. So, no sooner does the government attempt to put us on a heat diet than it turns out there is little heat to be had.

What this means is the hysterical claims of man-made global warming will become ever-more shrill, as even the pretext that once seemed to support those claims evaporates.
