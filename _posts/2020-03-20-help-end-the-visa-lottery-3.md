The visa lottery is dangerous; please cosponsor H.R. 479 to end it.

More than half of all immigrant families with children are on welfare and 90% of the increase in the uninsured is due to immigration. Why is the U.S. continuing to raffle off 50,000 permanent work permits each year?

Not only do these lottery work permits cost taxpayers money, but they also cost Americans jobs. These individuals are let into the United States without regard to their talents or skills (or lack thereof) and can compete against unemployed Americans for U.S. jobs. Doesn't this seem just a little bit unjust to you?

Moreover, the Office of the Inspector General has said that the visa lottery poses a significant threat to our national security. There is no doubt that this program needs to be ended. Please cosponsor H.R. 479 and help to end the problem!
