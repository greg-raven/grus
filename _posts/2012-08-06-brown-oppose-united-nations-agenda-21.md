Governor Jerry Brown,

I am writing to urge you to do everything in your power to expose the United Nations' Agenda 21 and prevent its implementation at all levels of government in your state.  
  
The United Nations' Agenda 21 was developed 20 years ago as an attempt to impose the extreme environmentalist agenda globally --- including in every state, city and town in the United States. Masked as a "green initiative" focused "sustainable development," it seeks to dictate and control every aspect of our lives.

Specifically, at risk from Agenda 21 are, among other things:

- Private property rights;
- The ability to choose what vehicle we drive and even our very means of travel, and
- Private ownership of family farms

What's scary is Agenda 21 is already taking hold in states and municipalities across America. In fact, the U.S. subsidiary of the International Council of Local Environmental Initiatives (ICLEI) --- the international body charged with implementing Agenda 21 at the local level --- claims membership by nearly 600 local governments in 49 states in America today.

Other states are considering resolutions that expose Agenda 21 and rejects its implementation. Most recently, Alabama become the first state to fully pass a law that prevents government at every level in the state from implementing Agenda 21. It is imperative that you draft and support passage of a similar resolution in your state and do everything in your power to stop Agenda 21 dead in its tracks.

It is imperative that you draft and support passage of a similar resolution in your state and do everything in your power to stop Agenda 21 dead in its tracks.

Sincerely,

Greg Raven
