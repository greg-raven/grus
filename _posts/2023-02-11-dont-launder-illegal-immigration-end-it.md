I was disappointed to hear Resident Biden tout amnesty during his State of the Union address instead of speaking on real strategies that will halt the border crisis he created.

Analysts have exposed how his new parole program is just a ploy to mask the astounding numbers of border crossers under his watch.

I urge you to work with your colleagues to stop releasing illegal migrants into the United States and require every business to use E-Verify.
