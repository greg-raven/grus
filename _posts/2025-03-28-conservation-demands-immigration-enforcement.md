Nature needs open spaces; reduce immigration-driven population growth.

Sincere efforts to conserve open spaces and to save America's beleaguered wildlife are more than offset by reckless immigration policies, which drive our nation's population growth. Some of the most threatened habitat and species in America are near population centers (e.g., in California and Texas) where immigrants are drawn to because of the higher demand for migrant labor, but this is a growing problem across the nation.

For two decades, NumbersUSA has quantified and chronicled the relationship between immigration, population growth, and sprawl. Those studies can be found at sprawlusa.com.

The U.S. Census predicts that America's population will add more than 20 million more people over the next 35 years. More than 90% will be due to immigration.

Please work with Congress on immigration legislation (lasting border security, an end to chain migration, mandatory E-Verify) to lower America's population growth rate and to help preserve our rich heritage of biodiversity.
