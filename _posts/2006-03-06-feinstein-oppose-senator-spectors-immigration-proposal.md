Thank you for standing up for American workers and opposing Sen. Specterâ€™s proposal to import a million additional foreign workers each year.

However, while you advocated enforcement, you also seemed to indicate that you will introduce a bill that would reward illegal aliens working in agriculture with jobs and residency. Those are mutually exclusive ideas. You need to live up to your oath of office: Protect America, protect Americans, and protect American jobs.

Americans do not want more cheap foreign labor driving down their wages. Neither should you.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We must start protecting our borders, no ifs, ands, or buts.
