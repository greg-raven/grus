I am concerned that lame duck Democrats will try to force an illegal alien amnesty through Congress while they still control the House of Representatives. According to one pro-illegal alien activist, the lame duck session is a "golden opportunity" to pass an amnesty, while another activist said that "another chance \[to amnesty illegal aliens\] likely won't come for years."

You and your Republican colleagues must block any legislation that amnesties or otherwise rewards illegal aliens. There is a crisis at the border and an amnesty for illegal aliens would only encourage more people to illegally enter the United States.
