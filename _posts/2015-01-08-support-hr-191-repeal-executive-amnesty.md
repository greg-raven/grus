Rep. Robert Aderholt has just introduced H.R. 191, the Repeal Executive Amnesty Act of 2015, which would not only defund President Obama’s executive actions to grant amnesty and work permits to millions of illegal aliens, but also reverse a number of executive actions taken by the Administration over the last several years. I urge you to tell GOP Leadership to include Rep. Aderholt’s bill in the upcoming DHS Appropriations bill.

Rep. Aderholt’s bill would prohibit the president’s use of granting parole and work permits to all illegal aliens. In doing so, millions of American workers and their families wouldn’t have to compete with illegal aliens as the economy produces new jobs. Currently there are 18 million Americans who want a full-time job, but cannot find one. A study by Investors Business Daily/TIPP found that 63% of all Americans oppose work permits for illegal immigrants, thereby not allowing them to compete with American workers for jobs.

The bill would also reinstate the Secure Communities program, where the FBI automatically sends fingerprints of anyone arrested or booked by police for a state or local criminal offense to DHS to check against its immigration databases. Before the program was disbanded, more than 283,000 convicted illegal aliens were removed as a result of Secure Communities. Pres. Obama’s immigration actions in November of last year dismantled this program.

In addition, the bill would close the loophole that played a large role in last summer’s border surge by treating illegal aliens from non-contiguous countries the same as contiguous countries, making them easier to remove. This will remove the likelihood of tens of thousands more unaccompanied alien children crossing into the United States seeking Obama’s amnesty.

I urge you to tell GOP Leadership to include Rep. Aderholt’s bill in the upcoming DHS Appropriations bill.
