Although states with high population growth have more political influence, there are considerable drawbacks. America is experiencing a "biodiversity crisis," mostly from habitat loss caused by our immigration-driven population. Wildlife species keep getting added to America's list of endangered and threatened wildlife, now exceeding a mind-boggling 1,300 species.

We know what is causing this wholesale assault on our wildlife --- America's runaway population growth is bulldozing and fragmenting our nation's wildlife habitat. The most effective and practical response to this tragic decline in biodiversity would be to lower our high rates of immigration which, according to the U.S. Census Bureau, will account for 90% of our population increase for decades to come, e.g., a projected 75 million more in 40 years.

Please support efforts that would reduce our rapid population growth, namely legislation that would create a humane immigration system that respects the dignity of every person while protecting our nation's dwindling biodiversity by allowing for America's population to stabilize.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
