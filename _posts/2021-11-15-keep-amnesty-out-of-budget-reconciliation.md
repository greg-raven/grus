I am dismayed that some anti-American worker and anti-legal immigrant worker Democrats are calling on Sen. Schumer and Vice President Harris to ignore the Senate parliamentarian and include an illegal alien amnesty in the budget reconciliation bill. In case you forgot, the parliamentarian did not mince her words; she was unequivocal that passing an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens goes far beyond its simple budgetary impact and needs to be carefully considered by Congress in standalone legislation.

It has been reported that a deal on the legislation is close and President Biden wants Congress to hold a vote next week. Please oppose any efforts to include an illegal aliens amnesty in the budget reconciliation bill and oppose the bill if the anti-American worker Members of Congress prevail and an amnesty is included in the legislation.

Sincerely,
