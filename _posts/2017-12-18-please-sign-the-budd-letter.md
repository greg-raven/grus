Congressman Ted Budd (R-NC) is circulating a very important letter to the House leadership.

His letter insists that the House leadership reject any move to kill concealed carry reciprocity while bringing the anti-gun Cornyn-Schumer "NICS Fix" bill to the House floor.

The Budd letter states, in part:

> "While we are pleased the House was able to vote on and pass the concealed carry reciprocity bill --- to allow law-abiding gun owners with gun permits to carry firearms in any state that recognizes carry rights --- we are concerned the Senate will separate these two bills and pass just the FIX NICS language, sending the measure back to the House without including the reciprocity language."

Rep. Budd is right on point because the problem he identifies is exactly what Republican and Democrat Senators are threatening to do.

I would urge you, in the strongest terms, to sign the Budd letter.
