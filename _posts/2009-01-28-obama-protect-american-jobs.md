Please do all you can to help American jobs and America’s jobless.  
  
During your campaign you promised to protect American jobs and I urge you to do all you can to accomplish this goal. I feel this can be done by supporting policies that would crack down on illegal employers who profit by exploiting an illegal workforce. With 6 million illegal workers currently holding non-farm jobs, you should encourage Congress to reauthorize and expand E-Verify under the SAVE Act to help employers put Americans and legal immigrants into these jobs.

NumbersUSA has sent you a letter requesting that you curb chain migration, the visa lottery, and the importation of foreign workers. It goes without saying that I completely approve of NumbersUSA’s letter and their suggestions. These suggestions are not a cure-all solution, but would certainly create millions of jobs for unemployed Americans.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
