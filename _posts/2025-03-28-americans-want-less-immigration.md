Immigration is too high. Mass immigration makes housing less affordable, our communities less sustainable, and good jobs less obtainable. After decades of stagnant wages and a declining labor force participation rate, Congress should make it easier for Americans to find jobs, not harder.

Sixty years ago, Congress passed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965. Annual immigration levels had averaged less than 300,000 per year for four decades, contributing to the greatest period of economic mobility in American history. Congress promised they were not increasing immigration. Congress was wrong. Annual green cards have increased to more than a million annually. The rise of the middle class halted, then reversed. Inequality has worsened. For millions of Americans, hard work alone is no longer enough to achieve the American dream.

Reduce immigration. Limit family based migration to spouses and minor children. Limit employment based immigration to truly world class talent (and pay them like they are). Limit refugees to our fair share of urgent need cases. Require businesses to use E-Verify to hire authorized workers. And stop giving away U.S. citizenship to tourists and lottery winners.
