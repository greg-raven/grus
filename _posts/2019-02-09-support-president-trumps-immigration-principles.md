I was very pleased to see President Trump’s list of immigration principles and I support most of them. Foremost among these principles are mandating the use of the E-Verify system and ending chain migration.

Mandating the use of the E-Verify system will remove illegal aliens from the workforce — there are 7 million illegal aliens working non-agricultural jobs — and ending chain migration will stop millions of new immigrants who are admitted without regard for their skills or abilities. This will make it far easier for Americans, especially the lower-skilled and less-educated among us, to find jobs.

I urge you to support all of President Trump’s immigration principles — especially mandating E-Verify and ending chain migration.

Contact me if you would like to talk about this,
