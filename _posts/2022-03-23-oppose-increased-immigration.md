*Sun Journal:* Tight labor markets help American workers.

As you know, the House slipped several immigration measures into the omnibus spending bill.

The visa programs in the omnibus bill will continue with the status quo of vulnerable groups competing against each other. For example, the article “Immigration and America’s racial reckoning” published in the Sun Journal noted that “Blacks earn one in 10 computer science degrees nationwide, but account for only 2.6% of Silicon Valley tech workers.” The reason for this? The article says it is because “seventy-one percent of tech workers in Silicon Valley today are foreign born.”

The people we all want to help the most, including minorities, are the ones being harmed the most by these unprecedented immigration numbers. I am asking that you confront how immigration has historically harmed Black communities and work towards fostering change that will create more just policies.
