Please work to make President Trump's State of the Union immigration goals a reality!

President Trump made it very clear that illegal immigration hits working-class Americans the hardest: "No issue better illustrates the divide between America's working class and America's political class than illegal immigration. Wealthy politicians and donors push for open borders while living their lives behind walls and gates and guards. "Meanwhile, working-class Americans are left to pay the price for mass illegal migration --- reduced jobs, lower wages, overburdened schools and hospitals, increased crime, and a depleted social safety net." Illegal aliens cost American taxpayers roughly $116 billion each year. This is $116 billion that won't go toward healthcare, education, social services, or other programs that benefit working Americans. This is a travesty that cannot be allowed to continue. However, I disagree with the president's call for more legal immigration. Legal immigration to the United States is already far too high and needs to be reduced. The majority of foreign workers in the U.S. are less-educated and lower-skilled and compete directly with America's most vulnerable for jobs.

Congress needs to follow the president's clarion call to make an immigration system that benefits all Americans and legal immigrants. You need to pass legislation that secures the borders, makes it difficult for illegal workers to take U.S. jobs, and penalizes employers that hire them.
