If you oppose amnesty, you must vote against Sen. Specter’s immigration proposal. It is a major illegal-alien amnesty.

Sen. Specter’s immigration proposal rewards lawbreakers with permanent residency making it a giant Reward Amnesty.

In fact, virtually all of the 10.2 million illegal aliens estimated to be in the United States as of January 1, 2004, would be rewarded with exactly what they broke U.S. law to obtain: Permission to work in the United States indefinitely.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. No more amnesties! Secure the border! Start interpreting the 14th Amendment correctly! Save our country!
