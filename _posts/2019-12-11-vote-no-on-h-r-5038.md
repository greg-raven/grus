H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, grants amnesty to illegal aliens and renews the outdated practice of indentured servitude. Please oppose H.R. 5038!

 H.R. 5038 doesn't "modernize" the farm workforce. It grants amnesty to illegal workers and expands the agricultural guest worker program into year-round jobs traditionally held by American workers. Vote NO on H.R.5038!
