H.R. 5038, the Farm Workforce Modernization Act, grants amnesty to illegal aliens and renews the outdated practice of indentured servitude. Please oppose H.R. 5038!

 H.R. 5038 doesnâ€™t "modernize" the farm workforce. It grants amnesty to illegal workers and expands the agricultural guest worker program into year-round jobs traditionally held by American workers. Vote NO on H.R.5038!
