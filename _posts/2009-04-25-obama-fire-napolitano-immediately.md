Americans are repulsed by the leaked DHS anti-terrorism security assessment summary that clearly targets mainstream Americans as dangerous extremists. One section of the report reads: "Rightwing extremism in the United States can be broadly divided into those groups, movements, and adherents that are primarily hate-oriented (based on hatred of particular religious, racial or ethnic groups) ..."  
  
But the rest of the sentence is an appalling shocker; "... and those that are mainly anti-government, rejecting federal authority in favor of state or local authority, or rejecting government authority entirely. It may include groups and individuals that are dedicated to a single issue, such as opposition to abortion or immigration." The assessment goes on to target veterans, people who believe that our immigration laws should be enforced, those who support the 2nd Amendment and those who may simply disagree with the policies of your administration. In short, this so-called security assessment targets the vast majority of Americans (Republicans, Democrats, and Independents) as subversives.

This leaked DHS security assessment is so repulsive that rational, freedom-loving individuals are disgusted by it. The only acceptable response is to FIRE Janet Napolitano immediately: No apologies should be accepted ... even her resignation should not be allowed. If Napolitano is not fired immediately, the American people can only assume that you support the concept of a draconian police-state.

I demand that DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano be FIRED without delay!

Sincerely,
