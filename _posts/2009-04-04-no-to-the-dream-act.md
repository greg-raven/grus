Why would you consider sponsoring the DREAM Act amnesty without first eliminating the chain migration categories that would reward the illegal alien parents of the amnestied illegal alien "children?"  
  
The DREAM Act is not a small amnesty for a select group of individuals. In fact, it allows illegal "teens" (i.e., anyone under 30) to petition for their parents, leading eventually to their aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins, to come to the United States.

In 2007, the big argument for this amnesty is that it is for teenagers who are here illegally because their parents broke the law. Even with the less-than-30 age requirement, this amnesty will apply to more than just teens ("humanitarian" and "family unity" exceptions were added to the age limit). Nonetheless, the argument is that the teenagers should not be punished for the crimes of their parents.

However, as soon as DREAM amnesty citizens are over 21, they can bring in their parents, who broke the law to get them into the country in the first place, back into the U.S. (or to keep them here legally after years of avoiding deportation). The chief criminals will be rewarded after all. And due to chain migration, the amnestied "teens" can petition for their aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents to get permanent U.S. residency as well.

This a back-door amnesty for the parents of these illegal "teens," and a chain migration nightmare for the country.

Please renounce your support for the DREAM Act amnesty. There are more than 12 million unemployed Americans and the Congress should not consider passing any amnesty when so many Americans are out of work (and so many illegal aliens have jobs). If you are determined to support such an anti-American bill, please make sure that it makes the use of E-Verify mandatory (to take away an incentive for another mass influx of illegal aliens) and eliminates the chain migration category for parents and adult siblings (to prevent this amnesty from ballooning into a mass influx of legal immigrants who will compete with unemployed Americans).
