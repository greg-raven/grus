Post-Brexit, there is no place for scapegoating immigrants or for bashing those of us who recognize the need to moderate immigration numbers.

Since 1990, the federal government has issued more than 1 million new green cards each year. That's 1 million new lifetime work permits to foreign workers in addition to the hundreds of thousands of guest worker visas also issued each year.

Even *New York Times* columnist David Brooks recognized the impact of uncontrolled immigration on American workers on PBS shortly after the Brexit vote.

Brooks said: "We've asked a lot of people who are suffering in this economy to accept extremely, radically high immigration levels. And we've probably overflooded the system."

I urge Congress to listen to the economic concerns coming from the American people on the issues of legal and illegal immigration, and I hope that Congress won't make the same mistakes that the elected officials in Great Britain made.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
