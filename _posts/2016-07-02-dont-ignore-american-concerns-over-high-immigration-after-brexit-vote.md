Post-Brexit, there is no place for scapegoating immigrants or for bashing those of us who recognize the need to moderate immigration numbers.

Since 1990, the federal government has issued more than 1 million new green cards each year. That’s 1 million new lifetime work permits to foreign workers in addition to the hundreds of thousands of guest worker visas also issued each year.

Even New York Times columnist David Brooks recognized the impact of uncontrolled immigration on American workers on PBS shortly after the Brexit vote.

Brooks said: "We’ve asked a lot of people who are suffering in this economy to accept extremely, radically high immigration levels. And we’ve probably overflooded the system."

I urge Congress to listen to the economic concerns coming from the American people on the issues of legal and illegal immigration, and I hope that Congress won’t make the same mistakes that the elected officials in Great Britain made.
