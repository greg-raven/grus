Gun Owners of America alerted me to the unconstitutional actions of the Biden Administration to restrict pistol braces. This trend of restricting my Second Amendment rights cannot continue. In the last election, all Governors who signed constitutional carry into law won reelection. Clearly, support for gun rights is an issue you can win on.

Please cosponsor Senator Marshallâ€™s SHORT Act (S. 4986) which will protect me or any of my pro-gun friends and family from becoming a felon for merely possessing pistol braces. These are items that the ATF had previously ruled did not turn commonly-owned firearms into NFA items. Passing the SHORT Act would protect Americans like me from more arbitrary decisions by the ATF to criminalize my lawful purchases.
