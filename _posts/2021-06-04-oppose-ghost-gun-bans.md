Please *oppose* the Untraceable Firearms Act.

I urge you to oppose strongly the so-called "Untraceable Firearms Act" (H.R. 3088/S. 1558).

These bills run afoul of Americans' right to home-build their own firearms, a perfectly lawful activity Americans have engaged in since before the founding. Technology changes, rights don't.

All State and Federal firearms laws still apply, even if you build your own firearm at home.

Just as the First Amendment would be of little value if I could not speak for myself, the Second Amendment recognizes that my right to keep and bear arms includes those arms I may make myself.

Oppose the "Untraceable Firearms Act" (H.R. 3088/S. 1558).
