I cannot understand why Reps. Mulvaney, Diaz-Balart, and Paul Ryan are going against the wishes of their own party by holding whip counts and possibly moving forward with pushing unpopular immigration "reform" legislation. Lobbyists for pro-amnesty groups are bragging about this development. If all goes well for these for these Representatives acting against core Republican principles, they hope to force votes before the August recess. I hope you will make it clear to the House Republican leadership that you will not go along with plans to support amnesty or immigration votes this year.

Currently, 18 million Americans cannot find a full-time job while 7 million illegal aliens have full-time jobs. On top of this, the United States brings in 125,000 new foreign workers each month. That's 1.5 million each year.

How is it fair to push legislation, such as that passed by the Senate or the H.R. 15 legislation supported by House Democrats, that would double legal immigration and give work permits to 11-18 million illegal aliens. This benefits illegal aliens at the expense of American workers.

I urge you to face down those on your party that want to bail out illegal aliens at the expense of American workers. Make it clear that you will not support any immigration legislation this year.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
