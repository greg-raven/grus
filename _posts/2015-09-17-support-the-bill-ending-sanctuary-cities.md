Please cosponsor H.R. 3314, the Protecting American Lives Act. Far too many Americans are dying at the hands of illegal aliens who have been arrested, but given sanctuary by sanctuary cities. I hope you will help save American lives by supporting this bill.

H.R. 3314 would:

- block SCAAP funding and other law enforcement grants to local jurisdictions that pass ordinances or otherwise prevent local officials from cooperating the federal immigration agents;
- require local jurisdictions to honor mandatory detainers;
- require States and political subdivisions to provide DHS with identifying information regarding each incarcerated alien who is believed to be inadmissible or deportable; and
- increase mandatory minimum sentences for the illegal re-entry of an alien who: (1) was previously denied admission, excluded, deported, or removed; or (2) was removed for certain criminal convictions or excluded for security-related grounds.

It is high time that states and localities are forced to observe immigration detainers and this legislation would make that happen. Please help to save American lives by cosponsoring H.R. 3314.
