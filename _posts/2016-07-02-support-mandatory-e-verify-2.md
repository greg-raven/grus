Please pass legislation that would require all employers to use E-Verify. Mandating E-Verify will prevent illegal aliens from finding jobs and help Americans get back to work.

Requiring employers to run new hires through the Chamber of Commerce-supported E-Verify system, would gently move illegal aliens out of U.S. jobs. Over time, the 7 million illegal aliens in non-agricultural jobs would be replaced by unemployed Americans and legal immigrants. While not solving Americaâ€™s unemployment or illegal immigration problems, mandatory E-Verify would certainly lessen their severity.

Clearly, this is an easy and effective way of putting unemployed Americans and legal immigrants in jobs currently held by illegal aliens while also shutting off the jobs magnet that lures so many to come to the U.S. illegally.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
