E-Verify reduces discrimination. An employer that uses E-Verify must use it for all new hires, and its use encourages employers to hire Hispanics, and immigrants of all kinds.

The current I-9 paper system requires employers to essentially make a judgment call. According to the Government Accountability Office, an estimated 10% of employers responded to the 1986 immigration law’s requirements by adopting “one or more practices that represent national origin discrimination … an additional 430,000 employers (9 percent) said that because of the law they began hiring only persons born in the United States or not hiring persons with temporary work eligibility documents.”

E-Verify would drastically reduce this kind of intentional or unintentional discrimination by confirming work authorization within seconds. I hope you’ll call for national E-Verify soon.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
