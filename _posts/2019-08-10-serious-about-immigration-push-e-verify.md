E-Verify reduces discrimination. An employer that uses E-Verify must use it for all new hires, and its use encourages employers to hire Hispanics, and immigrants of all kinds.

The current I-9 paper system requires employers to essentially make a judgment call. According to the Government Accountability Office, an estimated 10% of employers responded to the 1986 immigration law’s requirements by adopting "one or more practices that represent national origin discrimination ... an additional 430,000 employers (9 percent) said that because of the law they began hiring only persons born in the United States or not hiring persons with temporary work eligibility documents."

E-Verify would drastically reduce this kind of intentional or unintentional discrimination by confirming work authorization within seconds. I hope you’ll call for national E-Verify soon.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
