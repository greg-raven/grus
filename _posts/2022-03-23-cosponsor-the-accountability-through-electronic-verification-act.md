Stand up for workers and cosponsor E-Verify legislation.

I am very concerned that there are no Democratic Senators cosponsoring legislation to mandate E-Verify.

As a Democrat, I urge you to cosponsor S. 71, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act.

I strongly support the statement Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer made in 2009 that "... a biometric-based employer verification system with tough enforcement and auditing is necessary to significantly diminish the job magnet that attracts illegal aliens to the United States ..."

I believe Democrats are losing voters by not supporting American workers through measures like E-Verify. A Wall Street Journal poll conducted this month shows that Republicans have a 46% to 41% lead over Democrats regarding whom people plan to vote for, with Republicans now leading Democrats by 9 points among Hispanic voters, and they only trailing by 35 points among Black voters (compared to 56 points just four months ago).

Your support for E-Verify is crucial, as we are experiencing a devastating border crisis with no end in sight. Our border patrol is overwhelmed, and cartels, smugglers, and exploitative employers are the ones reaping the benefits.
