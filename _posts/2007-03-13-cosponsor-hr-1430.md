H.R. 1430, the Security and Fairness Enhancement for America Act, is important legislation. Please join Rep. Goodlatte and other Republicans in supporting this legislation.

Legislation similar to H.R. 1430 was passed by a broad, bipartisan majority (273--148) of bipartisan members in the House during the 109th Congress as an amendment to the House's enforcement-only bill (H.R. 4437). 

It was disappointing that the Senate failed to take up this important legislation, but we now have another chance of ending the fraud-ridden visa lottery program with H.R. 1430. 

House Republicans took the lead on this issue last year. I hope you will be part of a movement to pass this legislation again this year.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We need to do everything possible to reduce the number of people pouring into the United States.
