Martin Luther King, Jr. strived for racial equality and that equality has been achieved in many arenas. However, it is still lacking in terms of employment, particularly for Black men. I urge you to consider reducing immigration numbers, which are far too high, so that all Americans have a good chance of finding a job.

Dean Baker, an economist, went on PBS and told Judy Woodruff about a problem far too few Americans talk about:

> "The drop in labor force participation was sharpest for African Americans, who saw a decline of 0.3 percentage points to 60.2 percent, the lowest rate since December of 1977. The rate for African American men fell 0.7 percentage points to 65.6 percent, the lowest on record. The decline in labor force participation was associated with a drop in the overall African American unemployment rate of 0.5 percentage points to 11.9, and a drop of 0.6 percentage points to 11.6 percent for African American men."

This interview could not have come at a better time: in the days leading up to Martin Luther King, Jr. Day. Dr. King strove for equality in all areas and that dream has largely been fulfilled. However, Black Americans, particularly Black men, still are not able to attain jobs easily enough.

Immigration, while not the only reason, is a big reason of why Black men have trouble finding work. More than 1 million work permits are handed out each year and many of these new foreign workers compete directly against Black Americans for jobs. I hope you agree that this is a problem.

Dr. King's dream is still alive and I hope you will honor it by working to further it. Please work to reduce immigration numbers so that all Americans, no matter their race, have reason to dream.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
