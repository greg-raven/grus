It is vital that you and your fellow Republicans do not bow to pressure and include a DACA amnesty in the year-end spending bill. Doing so would set a dangerous precedent and encourage your pro-illegal alien colleagues to demand even larger amnesties. Moreover, Congress shouldn’t even consider an amnesty until the border is secured, E-Verify is mandated, and chain migration and the visa lottery are eliminated.

President Trump has made it clear that a DACA amnesty shouldn’t be in the December spending bill and Speaker Ryan has said that the spending bill won’t be used to amnesty DACA recipients. I urge you to make sure that the bill isn’t used to reward illegal aliens.
