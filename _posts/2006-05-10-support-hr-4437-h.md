Reps. Blunt, Peter King, and Sensenbrenner sent Speaker Hastert a letter endorsing the approach of H.R. 4437. I hope you'll contact Speaker Hastert and let him know you support that approach too.

The issue of what to do with the 12 million illegal aliens in the United States is almost always presented as a choice between amnesty and mass deportation. 

Fortunately, however, there is a third way. It's not just a choice between the politically impossible, disruptive approach of mass roundups and the rewarding of illegal aliens with citizenship. This third way is attrition  pressuring the illegal population through consistent, across-the-board law enforcement actions that induce annual reductions in the illegal population. 

This is the approach of the House-passed H.R. 4437 that was recently endorsed in a letter from Reps. Blunt, Sensenbrenner, and Peter King to Speaker of the House Hastert. Please tell Speaker Hastert you support the approach of H.R. 4437.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We need to take other steps as well, but this seems to be a great interim action.
