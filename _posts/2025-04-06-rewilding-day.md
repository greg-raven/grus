Save wildlife habitat by reducing immigration-driven population growth.

March 20th was World Rewilding Day, which raises awareness about our declining biodiversity. Rewilding aims to restore habitats and reintroduce apex species like wolves and bears. But America suffers from the relentless loss of habitat because of our runaway population growth, fueled primarily by immigration.
 
As Dave Foreman, founder of the Rewilding Institute, once said, "... we need to help people understand that cutting immigration is not anti-immigrant and not tied to nativism or racism, but tied directly to our ecological future."
 
Please support legislation that reduces immigration. These bills include requiring E-Verify for prospective employees, limiting chain migration to immediate family members, and abolishing birthright citizenship, which incentivizes illegal immigration.
