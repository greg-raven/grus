Please do whatever you can to oppose S. 1033, a bill by Sens. McCain and Kennedy that would result in 25 million more foreign workers and dependents over the next decade.

The media is reporting that S. 1033 will likely be included in the immigration bill that is considered by the full Senate this week. 

Please vote against any amendment and any bill that would reward illegal immigration or that would increase the already-too-high importation of foreign workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. I've just about given up any hope that you'll actually do the legal, moral, and ethical thing, and protect America, but once again I urge you to represent your constituents instead of the illegal invaders.
