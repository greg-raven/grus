Prioritize U.S. labor, not business greed, and end asylum abuse.

It is shameful that companies are planning to displace U.S. workers with migrants who are abusing our asylum system.

Tyson Foods is a prime example of a company hiring migrants while cutting U.S. jobs.

According to a recent Bloomberg article: "Tyson is joining the nonprofit Tent Partnership for Refugees, which was founded by Chobani yogurt magnate Hamdi Ulukaya, with a plan to hire some of the 181,400 migrants that have come through New York City's intake system over the past two years. The meatpacker already employs about 42,000 immigrants among its 120,000-strong U.S. workforce."

Yet, as *USA Today* reports, "More than 1,000 workers at another Tyson Food plant are out of work after the company announced it is permanently closing one of its Iowa facilities.

The move comes after the Arkansas-based company closed two chicken plants and announced job cuts last year and said four other plants were expected to cease operations within the first half of fiscal 2024."

Please contact me to discuss how you can support U.S. workers by ending asylum application abuse.
