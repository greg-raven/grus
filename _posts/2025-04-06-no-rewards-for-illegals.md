Limit birthright citizenship, mandate e-verify, and end chain migration.

The U.S. government rewards illegal immigration every day that Congress delays reform. Any person who came illegally during the Biden border crisis, and any person who overstays a visa today, can exploit loopholes in our immigration system. Their children are granted automatic citizenship, which sets them up to be sponsored for a green card themselves once the child turns 21. In the meantime, they can find illegal work from employers who don't verify that their employees are authorized to work.

I'm relieved to see the border numbers decline, but we will never rectify the border crisis without addressing the fact that the current system rewards illegal immigration.

Congress must limit birthright citizenship, mandate E-Verify, and end chain migration.
