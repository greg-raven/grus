We are shocked and dismayed that the House passed the illegal immigration-inducing "Affordable Health Care for America Act!" Why should American taxpayers pay for the health care of illegal aliens? Thank you for opposing this bill and please continue to oppose bills that benefit illegal aliens!

I still cannot understand why the House would pass a health care "reform" bill that has so many pro-illegal alien loopholes! This bill will not prevent illegal aliens from receiving Medicaid or accessing the health insurance "exchange." It will not even prevent illegal aliens receiving health exchange "affordability credits!"

It truly is disappointing that so many of your colleagues decided to give free health care to illegal aliens when more than 80% of Americans oppose doing this.

Nonetheless, I am grateful that you opposed this bill and I encourage you to continue to stand firm against pro-illegal alien legislation.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Let's all pray that this anti-American, anti-middle-class, illegal, and immoral legislation does not pass the Senate.
