Tuesday, Sen. Sessions spoke on the Senate floor about President Obama's role in the border influx.

In his floor speech, Sen. Sessions said:

> "In the internal Border Patrol memo, Deputy Chief Vitiello stressed that the only way to stop the flow is to show potential illegal immigrants that there will be real consequences for their actions: 'If the U.S. government fails to deliver adequate consequences to deter aliens from attempting to illegally enter the U.S. the result will be an even greater increase in the rate of recidivism and first-time illicit entries.'"

Deputy Chief Vitiello is right. Unless there is a true deterrence, people will continue to come to this country illegally. Unless those who come to this country are forced to leave, they will continue to come.

Please tell the White House to start enforcing the laws and securing the borders. Tell them to spread the message that illegal aliens are not welcome.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Illegal aliens are criminals. Treat them as such!
