Please oppose any attempt to impose any universal background check legislation.

I am writing today to ask you to oppose H.R. 8, H.R. 1112, and S. 42. These gun control bills will not have any affect on crime or criminals and they do not address the underlying causes of violence in America.

H.R. 8 and S.42 are so-called "universal" background check bills that will only hurt law-abiding citizens and erode our Constitutional rights.

Further, those intent on harming others will do so with or without a background check. Federal studies have found that criminals typically obtain firearms by stealing them, off the black market or via "straw purchases," which are already illegal.

H.R. 1112 allows the government to set arbitrary delays on firearm purchases that will only affect law-abiding gun owners and will do nothing to stop criminals who obtain their firearms through illegal channels including the black market.

As these bills move through the legislative process, I hope that you will keep these views in mind. This issue is very important to me and to our nation's future. Please oppose H.R. 8, H.R. 1112, and S. 42; and instead put your efforts toward addressing the root problem of violent crime.
