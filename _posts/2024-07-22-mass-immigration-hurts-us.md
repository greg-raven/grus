In his acceptance speech for the Republican nomination for president, Donald Trump reiterated a point he mentioned in his debate with President Biden: mass immigration was hurting Black and Hispanic workers.

There are numerous case studies of industries using an increase in foreign workers to displace Black American workers. Here are just a few:

Miriam Jordan, 2021. Black Farmworkers Say They Lost Jobs to Foreigners Who Were Paid More. *The New York Times.*

Frank Main and Dan Mihalopoulos, 2018. At major Northwest Side bakery, labor issues pit blacks vs. Hispanics. *Chicago Sun-Times.*
