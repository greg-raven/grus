On October 12, the Department of Homeland Security, in conjunction with the Department of Labor, announced that it would increase by 65,000 H-2B visas for fiscal year 2023. This nearly doubles the existing 66,000 cap. There are roughly 50 million working-age Americans without jobs. Americans are available to do the jobs that DHS wants to give away to foreign-born workers, IF they are offered fair wages and working conditions.

Not only do H-2B visas deny American workers job opportunities, they also represent cheap labor employment that will displace U.S. workers, especially vulnerable minorities whom some employers hold prejudices against.

The Government Accountability Office uncovered massive fraud and abuse associated with the H-2B visa program. Doubling the visas is a mistake.
