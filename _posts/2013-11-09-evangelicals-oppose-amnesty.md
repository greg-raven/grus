I believe it's important for Republican Members of Congress to realize that most evangelical Republicans do not approve of comprehensive immigration reform. The polls are clear on this.

A Pulse Opinion Poll asked Republican evangelicals:

"How much moral responsibility do you feel Congress has to help protect the ability of current illegal immigrants to hold a job and support their families without fear of deportation?"

Only 28% answered either "a lot" (10%) or "some" (18%). Unlike evangelical lobbyists, it's clear that Republican evangelicals feel a moral duty to protect vulnerable members in our own national community.

This must be why 65% of evangelical Republican voters feel the most pressing immigration priority for the government is to "protect unemployed Americans from foreign worker competition."

I hope you will take the results of this poll to heart, and not the advice of the evangelical lobbyists.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
