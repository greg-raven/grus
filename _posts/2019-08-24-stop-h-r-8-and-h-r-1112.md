H.R. 8 would criminalize the private sales of firearms that don't get prior government permission. Of course, the bill is not limited to that, as it criminalizes the "transfer" of a firearm without a Brady check.

The term "transfer" is nowhere defined, but it's clear from the bill that handing a gun to a neighbor for as little as one second is a "transfer" unless the person is covered by one of the bill's so-called exceptions.

So if you hand your firearm to a friend while you both are cleaning weapons, and then go into the kitchen to get another towel, you're a criminal and can go to prison for up to a year.

By the way, Gun Owners of America has demonstrated that the "exceptions" in the bill are merely trap doors that could, if enforced to the letter, put millions of gun owners in prison.

Please support the Second Amendment and oppose H.R. 8. And oppose H.R. 1112 which will effectively impose lengthy waiting periods on many law-abiding gun owners.
