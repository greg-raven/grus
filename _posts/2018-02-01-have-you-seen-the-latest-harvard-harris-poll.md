I wanted to tell you about a new Harvard-Harris poll of registered voters. It found that:

- 81% want immigration reduced from its current level of 1 million;
- 65% favor a deal that gives DACA recipients amnesty in exchange for ending; chain and lottery and increased border security;
- 68% support ending the visa lottery; and
- 60% support ending chain migration.

It is clear that American voters are against any efforts to increase immigration or give DACA recipients a deal that doesn’t end chain migration or the visa lottery. I urge you to take heed of this poll and refuse to accept a DACA deal that doesn’t end chain migration or the visa lottery.
