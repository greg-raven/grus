I was disappointed to see Congress expand the H-2B program for 2016 in the recent spending bill. This program is rife with fraud and abuse and allows low-skilled foreign workers to take jobs that could be taken by America's most vulnerable workers. I urge you not to increase the number of H-2B visas in future years. Congress' expansion of the H-2B program in the recent spending bill will allow any foreign workers who have held an H-2B visa over the last three years to be exempt from the 2016 caps. This is a gift to the business community who would rather hire cheap, foreign labor than hire unemployed Americans. The latest jobs report revealed that nearly 3 million Americans with a high school degree or less are looking for work. These vulnerable workers need jobs --- jobs that companies would rather give to foreign workers through use of the H-2B visa. Furthermore, the unemployment rate for teens sits at 16.1% --- more than three times the national average. Traditionally, jobs that are now being given to H-2B visa holders have gone to teens, so their high unemployment rate comes as no surprise. You were elected to help American workers get back to work not help foreign workers find jobs in the U.S. and big business drive down wages by hiring cheaper, foreign workers. I urge you to oppose any future increases in the H-2B guest worker program.
