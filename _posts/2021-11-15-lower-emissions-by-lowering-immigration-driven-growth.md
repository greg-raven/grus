To achieve a long-term reduction in greenhouse gas emissions, America must work toward population stabilization. This is a daunting goal because, as of today, the U.S. Census Bureau predicts that by 2060 America will grow by 79 million people, with roughly 90% due to immigration.

The sad reality is that right now before Congress there are legislative proposals containing immigration increases and legalization of unauthorized entrants that, when combined with chain migration, will put America's carbon emission goals even further out of reach.

Our best hope for a sustainable future is to reduce America's rapid population growth by lowering immigration rates. As someone personally committed to reducing emissions, I'm opposed to the efforts by Democrats to accelerate immigration-driven population growth and urge you to keep immigration increases out of any upcoming bills.
