One of the biggest draws for foreigners who try and come to the United States illegally is a job. By requiring that all employers use E-Verify, the United States can take a giant step towards ending all illegal immigration. I support mandatory E-Verify, I urge you to do so as well.

There are no valid excuses for allowing businesses to hire illegal workers, especially not when there are so many citizens and legal aliens struggling to find work. Making E-Verify mandatory will not burden employers, contrary to what opponents claim. Any human resources employee assigned to collect information for the Federal I-9 form would simply spend a few extra seconds typing the same data into the E-Verify system. Furthermore, mandating E-Verify will deter rampant hiring discrimination in favor of illegal aliens by greedy employers, because all new hires must be checked.

Please work with your House colleagues to make E-Verify mandatory for all employers and help end illegal immigration.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
