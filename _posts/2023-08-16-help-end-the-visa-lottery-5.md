Our nation currently allows 55,000 immigrants to come to the United States through this program. These individuals need not possess special skills or extraordinary talents, they need only sign up for the lottery and have their name drawn. Once they come to the United States they are free to compete against unemployed Americans for U.S. jobs.

Don't you think that eliminating this program is a good way of helping jobless Americans find work? I sure do.

Moreover, the Office of the Inspector General has said that the visa lottery poses a significant threat to our national security. This program must end!

Please cosponsor H.R. 1100, the SAFE for America Act, and help to end the visa lottery.
