Recently, Rep. Don Beyer was fact checked on his claim that U.S. population would actually shrink if legal immigration were reduced, but his claim was rated "mostly false" by Politifact. I hope you will not believe anyone who says that mass immigration is required to grow or sustain America's population.

Politifact, relying on data from Pew, said:

> "But the Pew study --- citing data from the U.S. Census Bureau --- undercuts much of Beyer's claim. It says, 'If no immigrants had entered the country after 1965, when the U.S. population numbered 193 million, the nation's population still would have grown --- to 252 million people by 2015, rather than 324 million.'"

Moreover, Politifact stated that America's population would continue to grow after 2015, even if no new immigrants were admitted:

> "Moving forward, Pew projects the U.S. population to expand from 324 million last year to 441 million in 2065 --- a 36 percent increase. With no immigration after 2015, Pew says the population still would grow but only to 338 million in 2065. That would be a 4 percent increase over 50 years."

I hope you will read Pew's research and accept that America doesn't need mass immigration to thrive.
