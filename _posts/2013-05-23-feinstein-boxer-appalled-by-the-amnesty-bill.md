I was appalled that the Senate Judiciary Committee just approved the Gang of Eight’s comprehensive amnesty bill. This legislation would repeat the mistakes of the 1986 amnesty bill by promising enforcement while ensuring amnesty. 33 million new work permits will be issued in the first ten years after the bill’s passage and you need to oppose this legislation.  
  
The bill front loads the amnesty for illegal aliens but is written to make sure the border is never secured. This amnesty bill would only require the Department of Homeland Security to submit a plan to achieve a 90% apprehension rate along the U.S. --- Mexico border and to submit another plan to determine if and where fencing is needed along the southern border (p. 10 of the bill).

At that point, 11.1 million illegal aliens would be granted amnesty (called Registered Provisional Immigrant (RPI) status in the bill) (p.11). They would simply have to show that they have not been convicted of a felony or more than two misdemeanors, unless they are immigration-­related crimes (p.64). Oh, and they have to say they are not gang members (p. 619) or terrorists (p.66).

Obviously. this bill is a farce designed to ensure the amnestying of all illegal aliens. Please oppose it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Every promise about this bill has been broken. There is to be no enforcement. Illegals will get welfare. There will be no substantive screening. Secure our border, and evict the illegals already here. Change our immigration policy back to what it was before 1965! You MUST do these things to save our country.
