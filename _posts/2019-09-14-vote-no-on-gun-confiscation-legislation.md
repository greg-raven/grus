98% of voters will NOT vote to reelect a legislator who votes for red flags

Gun Owners of America has released a poll of more than 17,000 voters indicating that 98% will not vote to reelect a legislator who votes for "red flag" gun grabs.

Not only that, the GOA poll found that 78% of gun owners consider themselves "single issue" voters on the subject of guns and the Second Amendment.

Sadly, some legislators have to find this out the hard way. In the lead up to the 2016 elections, Senator Kelly Ayotte earned a "D" rating from a state gun rights group after she voted for cloture on the Feinstein semi-auto ban. Many New Hampshire gun owners thus boycotted Ayotte in the 2016 election, and she lost by 1,017 votes!

GOA's Senior Vice President Erich Pratt went on Fox News and used Ayotte's blunder as an example of what can happen to Republicans who violate their oath and support gun control.

Then, Rush Limbaugh replayed GOA's appearance on his national show and reiterated that it is a "possibility" that Republicans lose their majority after supporting gun control.

Gun control is a political loser. So please oppose the three gun bills that were recently reported out of the Judiciary Committee:

1. 1) Magazine bans that will endanger law-abiding gun owners facing multiple attackers (H.R. 1186);
2. 2) "Red Flag" Gun Confiscation Orders (H.R. 1236) that will throw out Due Process; and,
3. 3) Hate crimes gun ban (H.R. 2708) which will impose a lifetime gun ban on gun owners for non-violent actions --- primarily because they held views Democrats don't like.

Instead, support concealed carry reciprocity (H.R. 38) and repeal gun-free school zones (H.R. 3200).
