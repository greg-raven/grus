American STEM workers, myself included, do not want you to allow legislation that increases foreign worker visas, to move through your committee. I hope your fundraising efforts in Silicon Valley do not mean that you support such legislation.  
  
More and more American workers, both STEM workers and those outside the industry, are having trouble finding work. All told, 20 million Americans cannot find a full-time job. Making matters even worse, 1.5 million new foreign workers are given new work permits each year. Why would anyone want to increase the number of foreign workers coming to the United States when Americans cannot find work?

American workers deserve better than legislation that would increase foreign worker imports. I urge you to oppose any such legislation that appears before your committee.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
