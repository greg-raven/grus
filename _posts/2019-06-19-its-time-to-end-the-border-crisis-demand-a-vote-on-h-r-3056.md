I’m shocked that the House has yet to vote on H.R. 3056, the Border Crisis Supplemental Appropriations Act, to deal with the ongoing border crisis. I urge you to demand an immediate floor vote on this badly needed spending package! This crisis has gone on long enough, and it’s time for Congress to act!
