I'm writing to ask you to STOP Obama's "Abortion Czar." "Abortion Queen" Sebelius' die-hard support for ALL forms of abortion --- especially the gruesome late-term abortions performed by her biggest political ally and financial backer, Killer Dr. George Tiller of Wichita, Kansas, makes her unfit to serve as head of Health and Human Services. The Senate should not confirm her nomination.

"Abortion Queen" Sebelius is currently under close and painful scrutiny because of her almost incestuous relationship with the infamous Dr. Tiller.

She's been caught red-handed under-reporting the amount of blood money she has accepted from Tiller over the years.

She even vetoed a bill that called for simple health inspections of the notoriously filthy abortion mills in Kansas, where one the disgusting abortionist refrigerated the body parts of unborn babies he had murdered, and then mixed them in with his lunchtime soup!

The Kansas State Legislature overwhelmingly passed a bill requiring health inspections of Kansas abortion mills, but "Abortion Queen" Sebelius --- who now wants to head the U.S. Dept. of Health and Human Services --- VETOED that bill!

STOP Obama's "Abortion Czar!" Vote NO on this dangerous nomination that would punish every unborn child. I will be watching your votes on this matter very closely. Thank you.
