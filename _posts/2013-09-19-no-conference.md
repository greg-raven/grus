I hope you will sign the letter Rep. Steve Stockman has written to House Speaker John Boehner. In it he argues that the Senate will use any House-passed immigration legislation as a vehicle to get their amnesty legislation to President Obama's desk. I hope you will sign this letter and show Speaker Boehner that he must ensure that amnesty is not passed through a conference committee.

The letter reads as follows:

> "Dear Mr. Speaker:
>
> "'If we go to conference, we would win.'
>
> That's Senator Harry Reid's assessment of the Democrats' strategy to take one or more Republican bills related to border security or immigration and seek to win in a conference committee.
>
> "Senator Chuck Schumer amplified upon the strategy; 'the end game strategy is to get to a conference with the Senate (comprehensive) bill by having the House pass a group of bills.'
>
> "The House conferees would, according to Reid's and Schumer's strategy, agree to conference the Senate's bill; resulting in the President signing a bill to award amnesty to millions of illegals.
>
> Beyond Schumer's belief he can get House Republicans into a conference, there is a serious parliamentary problem in agreeing to conference the bill.
>
> "According to the rules, if a bill goes to conference with one issue committed by the House and many issues committed by the Senate, the only question with respect to the non-House issues is whether how much of the Senate position to adopt. The House goes to conference with no position on any of those questions.
>
> "House Republicans must avoid any actions which could undermine the House's intention of passing narrowly-focused immigration-related bills.
>
> "Therefore, we respectfully ask that you not bring up any immigration-related bills without a commitment that the House will not conference House bills on immigration-related issues with a comprehensive or multi-issue bill from the Senate.
>
> "Thank you very much for considering our views on this critical issue."

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Boehner is a slippery eel. Don't let him get away from you on this one!
