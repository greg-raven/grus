Abolish birthright citizenship!

Often lost in the immigration debate is the issue of Birthright Citizenship. Birthright Citizenship is an outdated practice that lures foreign nationals to the United States so their unborn children can become U.S. citizens. Please work to end this ridiculous policy!

The United States is one of only two industrialized nations to still practice jus soli --- birthright citizenship. Australia eliminated it in 2007, New Zealand in 2006, Ireland in 2005, France in 1993, and the United Kingdom in 1983. It's time that America got with the times by ending this policy that rewards illegal immigration by allowing their children to receive automatic citizenship.

8 U.S.C. 1401 currently says that "a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth." Congress has used this clause to block automatic citizenship to other classes of people, including foreign diplomats. There's no reason why it can't do the same for the children of illegal-alien parents.

I urge you to get behind legislation that would end this outdated practice once and for all!
