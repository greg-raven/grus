I am concerned that the Department of Homeland Security is not implementing measures that would protect American workers.  
  
Due to the impending court case I was willing to give you and the Obama administration the benefit of the doubt regarding your postponement of President Bush's executive order requiring all federal contractors to use the E-Verify employment verification system. However, I cannot understand why you would postpone the implementation of the new rule regarding I-9 documents.

The new rule would require new hires to produce a current driver's license, passport or other identification document. This would ensure that only American workers and legal immigrants are able to acquire employment. If someone is unable to produce a current, valid identification document, there is a good chance that the person is not eligible to work in the United States.

I urge you to change your mind and starting implementing these common sense rules. There are more than 11 million unemployed Americans and these rules will help to find jobs.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
