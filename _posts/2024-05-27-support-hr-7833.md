Although I'm not sure where you stand on this issue, I feel strongly that you should support H.R. 7833, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, to end chain migration to prioritize jobs and wages for Americans.

While it is worthwhile to unite nuclear, immediate family members, it is troubling that a potentially never-ending migration chain can be created from one legal immigrant.

Chain immigrants are admitted to the U.S. without any regard for their skills and contributions or their negative impact on the jobs and wages of Americans forced to compete with them. Vulnerable workers who have historically higher unemployment and lower labor participation rates are particularly negatively impacted by chain migration.

Please contact me to discuss how you can prioritize U.S. workers by supporting H.R. 7833, the Nuclear Family Priority Act.
