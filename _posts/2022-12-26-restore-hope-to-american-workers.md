Immigration should not undermine U.S. workers.

According to the Economic Policy Institute, over 55 million people are employed in frontline jobs in the U.S. The majority of these jobs are in service industries such as health care (30%), agriculture (20%), and industrial, commercial and residential facilities and services (12%).

High immigration levels threaten these hard-working Americans and their families by reducing wages and bargaining power.

The number of immigrants we welcome to the U.S. should not be so high as to undermine the American worker who should always be first in the hiring line.

Please support mandatory E-Verify, and the ending of chain migration and birthright citizenship.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally.
