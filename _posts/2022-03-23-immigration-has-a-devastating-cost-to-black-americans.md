Reducing immigration helps American minorities.

In light of the omnibus spending bill, I wanted to point you to a recent article in The Philadelphia Tribune that summarizes how immigration has harmed Black Americans. The author, T. Willard Fair, writes in his commentary article titled "Immigration comes at a devastating cost to Black Americans" that "progress among Black workers leveled off starting around 1970, five years after Congress passed laws that significantly increased rates of immigration, from roughly 250,000 per year in the middle of the 20th century to over 1 million annually today."

Unsurprisingly, the article leads us to a 2006 paper published by the National Bureau of Economic Research that estimates that between 1980 and 2000, increased immigration has led to "reduced the wage of Black high school dropouts by 8.3 percent, reduced the employment rate by 7.4 percentage points, and increased the incarceration rate by 1.7 percentage points."

It is time to bolster the Black community by tightening the labor market by reducing the unprecedented levels of immigration. I urge you to support the American workforce by supporting immigration policies that are reflective of this position. We must finally fulfill the Barbara Jordan Commission’s recommendations that called for an end to chain migration and mandated national E-Verify.
