I am writing to you today to inform you that I stand in opposition to H.R. 1004, H.R. 1005, H.R. 1006, H.R. 1007 and H.R. 1008.

These extremely anti-gun and unconstitutional bills are meant to seem "reasonable" or "benign" but they are anything but. I will not stand by while the Congress uses these bills to trample all over my fundamental rights.

I therefore urge you to vote NO on the above proposed violations of the Second Amendment and our U.S. Constitution.
