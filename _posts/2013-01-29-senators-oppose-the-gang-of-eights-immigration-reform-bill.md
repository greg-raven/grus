Senators:

The "Gang of Eight" Senators have released the details for a new immigration reform bill, but after taking a closer look, this proposal is nothing more than the failed ideas from 2007. I oppose a mass amnesty, and urge you to do the same.  
  
The new proposal doesn’t address the more than 1 million legal immigrants that come to the United States each year, and it doesn’t address the magnets that have led to 11 million illegal aliens living in the United States.

Yes, the proposal does discuss the need for border security and a workplace verification system to ensure jobs don’t go to illegal workers, but only after 11 million illegal aliens receive legal status. They may call that a "pathway to citizenship," but I call it an amnesty!

I urge you to oppose amnesty and support real solutions that finally solve the issue of illegal immigration and consider legal immigration numbers that serve in the national interest.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
