The House Appropriations Committee approved an amendment to the Financial Services spending bill that would allow DACA recipients to compete with American workers for Federal jobs. So much for Congress putting American workers first!

Federal jobs are reserved for U.S. citizens, and taxpayers should not be forced to pay the salaries of illegal aliens who received an unconstitutional executive amnesty.

Millennials are struggling and are most likely the group to be affected by this provision. It's bad enough that they have to compete with illegal aliens for regular jobs, but if this bill passes and gets signed into law, they'll have to compete for government jobs as well.

I hope you'll do the right thing and help get this provision stripped from the bill before it's passed by the House.
