I am glad you wrote an op-ed to highlight the dangers of the EB-5 visa program. I hope you will do all you can to make sure the program is not renewed.

The EB-5 visa program is a fraudster’s dream. The program allows people to turn their ill-gotten gains into U.S. citizenship as USCIS is often unable to determine the source of an applicant’s funds. Given the massive backlog for visas, allowing such people to move to the front is reprehensible.

Thank you for speaking out against this program.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
