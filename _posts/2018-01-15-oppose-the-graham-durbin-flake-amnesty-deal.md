The DACA amnesty "compromise" proposed by Sens. Durbin, Graham, and Flake is no compromise at all! It is simply a mass amnesty for millions of illegal aliens, with only token enforcement elements. To be specific, this mass amnesty proposal does not:

- end chain migration;

- eliminate the visa lottery; or

- mandate the use of the E-Verify system.

Moreover, this amnesty "compromise" doesn't apply to only DACA recipients, but is a DREAM Act writ large because it applies not only to DACA recipients, but to all illegal aliens who came to the U.S. as minors.

Please do not support the Durbin-Graham-Flake amnesty deal, it is simply a mass amnesty in sheep's clothing.
