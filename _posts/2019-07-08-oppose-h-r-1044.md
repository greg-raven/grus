Please oppose H.R. 1044 to remove the per-country cap on employment visas.

H.R. 1044 proposes to scrap the per-country cap on employment-based green cards.

According to the Congressional Research Service, "shorter wait times for LPR status might actually incentivize greater numbers of nationals from India, China, and the Philippines to seek employment based LPR status. If that were to occur, the reduction in the number of approved petitions pending might be short-lived. In addition, absent a per-country ceiling, a handful of countries could conceivably dominate employment based immigration, possibly benefitting certain industries that employ foreign workers from those countries, at the expense of foreign workers from other countries and other industries that might employ them."

Allowing countries such as India to dominate employment-based visas would have a deleterious effect on American workers because they tend to be lower-skilled and willing to accept lower wages, reducing wages and making it more difficult for Americans to compete.

Please oppose H.R. 1044.
