Thank you for supporting Rep. Sensenbrenner's H.R. 4437 to increase border security and interior enforcement.

H.R. 4437 finally mandates that every employer in the United States use the federal verification system that quickly and easily determines if a new hire is legally eligible to work here. This system for verifying Social Security numbers would stop most illegal aliens from getting jobs with legitimate employers. While no single enforcement measure would stop all illegal immigration, this is the single-most important solution to rectifying our nation's half-hearted effort to tackle the problem. Thank you for supporting H.R. 4437 to immediately begin to reduce our illegal alien population.
