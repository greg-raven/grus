Thank you for voting in favor of the Blackburn and Aderholt amendments that defund Obama’s amnesties and protect American workers. This is only the first step. I hope you’ll continue to fight until this becomes law.

Defunding the president’s amnesties is critical to securing our nation, respecting the rule of law, and helping Americans get back to work. Thank you for voting in favor of the amendments.

I realize that these amendments are only the first step to stopping Obama’s amnesties. But please continue to vote in the interests of your constituents and our nation’s security until they become law.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
