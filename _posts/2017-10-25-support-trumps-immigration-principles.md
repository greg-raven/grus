I was very pleased to see President Trump's list of immigration principles and I support each and every one. Foremost among these principles are mandating use of the E-Verify system and ending the chain migration.

Mandating the use of the E-Verify system will remove illegal aliens from the workforce --- there are 7 million illegal aliens working non-agricultural jobs --- and ending chain migration will stop millions of new immigrants who are admitted without regard for their skills or abilities. This will make it far easier for Americans, especially the lower-skilled and less-educated among us, to find jobs.

I urge you to support all of President Trump's immigration principles --- especially mandating E-Verify and ending chain migration.
