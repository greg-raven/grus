I don't understand why you are making amnesty a priority when middle class Americans struggle to make ends meet.

In your inaugural address, you mentioned the "shrinking few who do very well and the growing many that barely make it." Amnesty does NOT help middle class Americans who struggle to make ends meet. Instead, it helps the privileged few who profit from paying workers lower wages.

Please do not use your upcoming State of the Union address to push for an amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
