Senator:

It is ridiculous that our state's attorney general is trying to get Arizona's SB 1070 overturned at the Supreme Court! You can help to alleviate the attorney general's concerns by cosponsoring mandatory E-Verify legislation.

The brief filed by the attorneys general makes one thing clear: SB 1070 works. The brief says that the legislation will "\[redirect\] undocumented immigrants to other states." However, do you know why this is the case? You are the reason this is the case.

To be fair, you are not the only reason. You are only 1 out of 535 reasons, so you certainly have company. Because Congress refuses to act and pass mandatory E-Verify legislation, illegal aliens are free to go to other states and find jobs. And make no mistake, these illegal aliens are taking jobs from American and legal immigrant workers. This is not something our nation needs right now, especially not with 20 million Americans unable to find a full-time job.

I hope you will do what these attorneys general are asking and put a 50-state solution in place. That 50-state solution has a name --- it's called mandatory E-Verify. Please cosponsor it today.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We have a more strict law on the books in California in CPC Section 834b. Let's work on enforcing that and leave Arizona alone!
