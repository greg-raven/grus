As your constituent and a strong supporter of our Second Amendment rights, I write today urging you to oppose any new gun control measure that places undue burdens on law-abiding Americans, including the latest bills H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.

H.R. 8 is the gun control movement's latest attempt to restrict the rights of law-abiding citizens by criminalizing the private transfer of firearms. This bill is nothing more than a feel-good measure that will do nothing to address the root cause of violent crime. Instead of introducing legislation aimed at curtailing the rights of law-abiding Americans, Congress should focus on reforming our broken mental health system and providing law enforcement with every tool necessary to protect our schools and strengthen our communities.

H.R. 1112 adds more undue burdens to law-abiding gun owners. This bill creates an arbitrary delay in the firearm purchasing process that will make it more difficult for an individual to protect himself or his family.

Please defend the Constitution and protect the Second Amendment. Please stand strong and oppose H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.
