I am upset about Resident Biden's unconstitutional executive orders.

I oppose each of the following actions:

- The targeting stabilizing braces in an attempt to re-classify pistols or firearms into a short-barreled rifle subject to the National Firearms Act.
- Publishing model "red flag" legislation so anti-gun neighbors and co-workers can target lawful citizens they may disagree with.
- Erroneously targeting 3D printing and 80% receivers as "ghost guns."
- Nominating former ATF agent and anti-freedom activist David Chipman to be Director of ATF.

I strongly encourage you to raise oppositions to these actions with the Biden administration! Congress *must* assert itself as a co-equal branch against Resident Biden's unprecedented use of executive actions.
