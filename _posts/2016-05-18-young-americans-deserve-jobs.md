Nearly 40% of young Americans with a high school education or less cannot find a job. The seasonal and entry-level jobs available for previous generations are simply not there because employers are able to hire an increasing number of H-2B workers. To make matters worse, some of your colleagues want to quadruple H-2B numbers as part of the FY2017 DHS appropriations bill. Please do all you can to prevent this from happening so that these Americans are able to enter the workforce.

Data from the government reveals that nearly 40% of less-educated, working-age Millennials ages 18-29 don’t have a job. That’s more than 15 million young-adult high school grads and high school dropouts who aren’t working. This is truly a deplorable situation.

To make matters much worse, far too many of your colleagues are pushing for language in the FY2017 DHS appropriations bill that would quadruple H-2B numbers to 264,000. Increasing H-2B workers only benefits business owners who prefer to pay temporary foreign workers a meager wage than pay young Americans a fair wage.

I urge you to do all you can to give these young Americans a fighting chance of entering the job market. Our country has more than enough workers to fill these jobs and has no need to import even more H-2B workers. Please oppose efforts to quadruple H-2B visa numbers as part of the FY2017 DHS appropriations bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Americans first!
