I completely agree with the Heritage Foundation’s assertion that the White House is promulgating falsehoods in an effort to force the Senate’s immigration bill on the American people. Please do all you can to prevent this bill from becoming law.  
  
The White House and other pro-amnesty groups like to tell everyone that the Senate’s immigration bill would “reduce the deficit.” Nothing could be further from the truth.

According to the Heritage Foundation, a properly functioning immigration system could help our economy grow and act to reduce the deficit. However, the amnesty portion of the Senate’s bill would place an enormous cost on American taxpayers. According to Heritage fellow Robert Rector:

“Amnesty and citizenship would make 11.5 million illegal immigrants eligible for Social Security, Medicare, Obamacare, and more than 80 different means-tested welfare programs such as food stamps and public housing. The average illegal immigrant is 34 years old and has a 10th-grade education. At that age, education levels would increase very little after amnesty.

Under the Senate-passed amnesty bill, each current illegal immigrant would receive more than $900,000 in government benefits over his lifetime while paying around $300,000 in taxes — a net cost of more than $600,000 to taxpayers. Even if the wages of amnesty recipients were to soar by 25 percent, the long-term costs per recipient would be more than $500,000 — costs ultimately borne by the American taxpayer.”

The Senate’s immigration legislation would cost American taxpayers trillions of dollars; not add value to the economy as the White House likes to claim. Please do all you can to stop this bill and to pass sensible immigration legislation.

P.S. Stop all immigration, evict the illegals (including “anchor babies”) who are already here, and return to pre-1965 immigration rules!
