We hope you will vote in favor of the Aderholt and Blackburn amendments to the DHS spending bill. Defunding the president’s executive amnesties is a top priority and these amendments will do a lot to achieve that goal.

These amendments are critically important because they would:

- Defund implementation of all Obama and DHS November 2014 memoranda;
- Defund the processing of applications and renewals of Obama’s 2012 DACA program;
- Defund 4 of the 5 Morton Memos that deal with prosecutorial discretion and detail who ICE agents can and can’t deport; and
- Prohibit federal benefits from being given to any illegal alien covered by the November memoranda.

Defunding the president’s amnesties is critical to securing our nation, respecting the rule of law, and helping Americans get back to work. I hope you will do all you can to support these amendments and pass the spending bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
