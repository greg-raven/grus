I cannot understand your vote in favor of H.R. 1004.

According to the Congressional Research Service, "shorter wait times for LPR status might actually incentivize greater numbers of nationals from India, China, and the Philippines to seek employment based LPR status. If that were to occur, the reduction in the number of approved petitions pending might be short-lived. In addition, absent a per-country ceiling, a handful of countries could conceivably dominate employment based immigration, possibly benefitting certain industries that employ foreign workers from those countries, at the expense of foreign workers from other countries and other industries that might employ them."

Allowing countries like India to dominate employment-based visas will have a deleterious effect on American workers because they tend to be lower-skilled and willing to accept lower wages, reducing wages and making it more difficult for Americans to compete.

I hope you will consider the impact of legislation on American workers whenever you are voting on immigration bills.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
