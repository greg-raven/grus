92% of gun owners would not vote for a senator who supports universal background checks

It is not without reason that Senate Republicans overwhelmingly rejected the Manchin-Toomey Universal Background Check/Gun Registration bill in 2013.

Now, thanks to the Daily Caller, we know that Attorney General William Barr is trying to bring back this anti-gun garbage to the same senators who already rejected it.

Barr claims to deal with "commercial" transactions, but deceptively defines "commercial" to include virtually every private sale.

Every gun and gun owner would either have a 4473 or an indistinguishable "Bill of Sale / Chain of Title." Gun Owners of America has documented that the ATF is already scanning these 4473 forms into a national registry in connection with its 18 USC 923(g) annual inspection. Barr’s registration proposals will just make an existing problem even worse.

Don’t be fooled by the nebulous language about alternatives to 4473s. This labyrinthine process that Barr is pushing would require information which would appear on a 4473 to be submitted to the FBI. A "Bill of Sale / Chain of Title" documenting the buyer and the gun would be expected to be "voluntarily" left with the FFL --- thereby creating a process which is no different than retaining a 4473.

In other words, no matter how you look at this, the legislation is a system of gun and gun owner registration.

This means that when a future President Beto O’Rourke (or Joe Biden) comes to "take people’s AR-15," they’ll know where they are and who has them. Universal Registration Checks are simply a prelude to gun confiscation --- Beto-style.

And all the while, background checks would have been ineffective in stopping mass shootings. In fact, one cannot think of a major mass shooting in this century where a background check on private sales would have prevented it.

Even in the recent shooting in Odessa, Texas, the gun was sold by a person who, apparently according to press reports, was illegally manufacturing and selling firearms. So requiring an illegal seller like him to run the sale through a background check would be ludicrous.

In a survey of more than 17,000 gun owners, 92 percent of respondents told Gun Owners of America that they would NOT vote to reelect a Senator who supported Universal Background Checks.

And 78% of gun owners consider themselves a "single-issue voter" on the Second Amendment.

This is why Kelly Ayotte is no longer in the Senate, as she lost by 1,017 votes after supporting gun control.

So unless you want to destroy the Republican base, please oppose this anti-gun legislation.
