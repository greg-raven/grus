Details about the huge amnesty to be included in the budget reconciliation bill are out, after being passed by the House Judiciary Committee. It’s every bit as bad as I feared, including amnesty for most of the illegal aliens in the U.S.

Practically nothing keeps any illegal alien from automatically qualifying! Welfare dependency, drug addiction, previous deportations, failure to show up for immigration proceedings, even communicable diseases like coronavirus … it’s all permitted!

Each one of these recipients will receive on average $129,000 more from Social Security and Medicare than they and their employers will pay (according to a Center for Immigration Studies analysis.) The lifetime cost of approving 8 million people?

One trillion dollars.

That’s more than $3,000 from every man, woman, and child living in America today. And that’s only the cost to Medicare and Social Security; that does not even count the cost of additional infrastructure, education, or other government programs. It also doesn’t include the effect of lower wages or the cost of providing government aid to displaced workers.

Keep in mind, this bill does NOTHING to prevent future illegal immigration and future amnesties. No E-Verify. No increased border enforcement. No added Border Patrol officers.

Please do everything you can to defeat this bill.
