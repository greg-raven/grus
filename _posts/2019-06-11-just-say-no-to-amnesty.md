Oppose amnesty legislation --- focus on the border surge!

I'm very disappointed that the U.S. Senate may soon debate and vote on legislation to amnesty illegal aliens. The crisis at the border is overwhelming the Border Patrol and USCIS and it is showing no signs of abating. People are crossing the border with the expectation of receiving an amnesty; the Senate voting on amnesty legislation will only reinforce these expectations.

I hope you will oppose any effort to give amnesty to illegal aliens and I hope you will do all you can to contain the border surge.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Especially with Gavin Newsome giving away even more free medical care to anyone who can drag his carcass across the border, it is now or never to preserve what is left of our once-beautiful, once-prosperous state.
