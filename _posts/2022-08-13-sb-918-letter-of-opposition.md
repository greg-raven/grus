I am writing in strong opposition to SB 918, which will make significant changes to Concealed Carry Weapons (CCW) procedures that will do nothing but complicate the process and increase the costs of obtaining a permit by law-abiding citizens. It is apparent that this bill is an attempt to circumvent the ruling from the United States Supreme Court in New York State Rifle and Pistol Association v Bruen, which legally established California as a “shall issue” state.

Lawful CCW holders are not killing, injuring, or traumatizing individuals with acts of gun violence or terrorism. The existing CCW system operated by the California Department of Justice and other issuing authorities have everything needed for law enforcement to effectively do their job. The proof is that CCW holders in California are among the most law-abiding citizens in the state.

I strongly oppose SB 918.
