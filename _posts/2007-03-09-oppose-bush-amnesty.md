I am writing to make clear my opposition to any sort of plan to reward illegal aliens, including the latest scheme by the Bush Administration to create a step-in-step-out amnesty.

Pence and Hutchison appear to have done everything they could to keep illegal aliens working in this country without the public catching on to the fact that this is a giant foreign worker amnesty that will further depress wages and job security for American workers and their families. 

I find it disgusting that members of Congress continue to spend their time finding new ways to import cheap labor instead of protecting our own vulnerable workers. Do Americans really not deserve a living wage? Is a middle-class lifestyle only for the lucky few in this country? That's the message coming out of Washington these days --- and it stinks. 

Please don't be fooled by claims that the most recent Bush Administration immigration plan is some sort of compromise immigration proposal. 

Although some of the details are still unclear, it sounds as if most of the 12 million illegal aliens would be legalized, allowed to work and live in the U.S. for the rest of their lives as long as they can find a job. 

But keeping the illegal aliens on a short-leash with periodic-year renewals allows their employers to have a lot of control over them, turning them into little more than indentured servants. 

I oppose this plan to create a permanent underclass of workers in the United States and hope you will too.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Uncontrolled immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
