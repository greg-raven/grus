America's endless population growth is extinguishing Nature's light shows.

Last week *The New York Times* reported on the Lyrids meteor shower. But almost all Americans missed it because our nation's night skies continue to get washed out by light pollution. As America's population density increases, so do concentrations of artificial light.

Dark skies are disappearing at an alarming rate across our nation, with about 80 percent of Americans not even able to see the Milky Way. Improved street lights and conservation measures cannot compete with America's soaring population growth.

The Census Bureau predicts that America's population will grow an additional 70 million by 2060, with roughly 90% due to immigration. Please work to slow down America's immigration-driven population growth by limiting chain migration and securing our border. Our nation's night skies (and quality of life) depend on it.
