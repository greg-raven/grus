Please oppose H.R. 2510/S. 1108.

I urge you to OPPOSE firearm magazine capacity restriction legislation (H.R. 2510/S. 1108).

America has tried magazine capacity restrictions bills at both the state and federal levels. Not once have these measures had any marketable impact on crime, though it is dubious that that is ever the real intent of these bills.

Further, this legislation is a direct attack on the liberty and property of American gun owners. A free society should not restrict the arms of its citizens while its law enforcement, military, and security apparatus are armed to the teeth.

I encourage you, in the strongest terms, to oppose these bills (H.R. 2510/S. 1108) and support the Second Amendment rights of your constituents.
