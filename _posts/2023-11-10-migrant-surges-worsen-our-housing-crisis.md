- Include H.R. 2 in funding bill.

I am outraged that the current, record migrant surge in the U.S. is worsening America's housing crisis and costing taxpayers dearly.

The Urban Institute's Housing Matters Initiative has detailed how immigration causes a significant increase in home prices and rents in and around the metropolitan areas where migrants settle. Immigration at the levels we are currently experiencing most negatively affects working-class people who are more likely to rent their homes.

Resident Joe Biden has sent Congress a request for $13.6 billion in "border security." However, Biden's proposal will not secure our borders to end our crisis but will only expand the processing of migrants into the U.S., thus encouraging more migrants to come.

The House-passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act (along with its Senate companion, S. 2824), would stop our crisis by ending asylum and parole abuse, blocking catch and release policies, and mandating E-Verify.

Please address our migrant and housing crises by including H.R. 2 in its upcoming funding legislation to keep the government open.
