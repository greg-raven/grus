I am writing to demand that you refuse to ratify the Copenhagen Climate Treaty.  
  
The Copenhagen Climate Treaty will strip America of its Sovereignty, and subject the citizens of the United States to laws, rules and huge taxes levied by a one-world, elitist, governing body that wants to steal America's wealth to punish us for our success as a nation. Worst of all, Americans will NOT have the power to vote these elitists out of office, impeach them, or hold them accountable in any way whatsoever. This is taxation without representation.

America's sovereignty, prosperity, and economic independence are all at stake. This is NOT a green or an environmental issue. The Copenhagen Climate Treaty is nothing short of a scam to lead our great nation into servitude.

For the sake of our economy, our sovereignty, and our freedom, I respectfully request that you do not even consider ratifying the Copenhagen Climate Treaty.

Sincerely,

[Greg Raven](https://www.gregraven.org/)
