I believe you need to help President Obama to fight income inequality by reducing the future flow of foreign citizens given green cards and lifetime work permits.

Sen. Jeff Sessions is right to point out that low-skilled immigration is driving low-skilled American workers out of the workforce:

> "Harvard professor Dr. George Borjas found that high levels of immigration between 1980 and 2000 caused the wages of lower-skilled American workers to drop nearly 8 percent. He also found current immigration levels have resulted in a $402 billion annual wage loss for workers but a $437 billion increase in profits for business owners."

The current system does not benefit American workers. Passing legislation to bring in even more foreign workers will only help the rich to get richer and the poor to get poorer. Please help all American workers by supporting legislation to reduce immigration numbers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
