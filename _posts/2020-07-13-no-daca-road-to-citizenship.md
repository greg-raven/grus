I am writing in response to your Telemundo interview of June 10, 2020, where you stated that you will be giving certain illegal aliens a "road to citizenship" by signing a major immigration Executive Order. This unlawful unilateral action would legitimize Obama's unlawful DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals) protections for illegal alien offspring.

Do you remember targeting DACA when kicking off your first presidential campaign, vowing you would "immediately terminate President Obama's illegal executive order on immigration immediately" in your presidential announcement speech on June 16, 2015, and again during an August 31 rally in Arizona? I do. It's one of the reasons my wife and I voted for you. I'll bet your recent flip-flop shocked millions of patriots like myself, as it represents a total reversal of your repeated campaign promises to America.

I can only guess at the betrayal felt by Angel Moms, Dads, and families who stood solidly with you at rallies across America during your 2015-16 campaign. These appearances and speeches by grieving, courageous families whose loved ones had been killed by illegals, were seen and heard by over 100 million voters and played a pivotal role in your nomination and election to the Presidency.

But it does not stop there. Your "road to citizenship" for 700 thousand so-called DACA children, some of whom are now up to 40 years old, also belies your promises to Angel families when you spoke to them on September 17, 2016, at The Remembrance Project National Conference. With nearly 40 grieving family members and over 500 supporters present, you promised that your administration's top priorities would be stopping illegal alien crime through building the wall and removing the illegals. To date, neither promise has been fulfilled, and Americans are still being killed and victimized daily by illegal aliens, even as you now support amnesty.

Hearing the words of your impending DACA amnesty has also re-victimized Angel families. Without exception, Angel families across America view this as a betrayal of your promises to them. And now, many have made promises of their own: If you go forward with DACA amnesty, they, their friends, and families will not vote for you this fall.

On September 5, 2017, you officially ordered an end to DACA, giving Congress six months to pass a bill to save the policy and tweeting: "Congress, get ready to do your job --- DACA!" As the date approached when Dreamers would lose their protections, a terrorist attack in New York City perpetrated by a suspect who was in the country on a green card prompted you to take more drastic immigration measures: on November 1, 2017, you announced your intention to end the Diversity Visa Lottery (also known as the green card program) and the following day, ruled out addressing DACA in a year-end bill that would have extended the Dreamers' protections.

In the broader concern of national security, a DACA amnesty will surely be seen across the world that America accepts foreign invaders sneaking into our country, bringing their children, bringing drugs, bringing diseases, and stealing American jobs and lives. It is not. You must not allow it. Amnesty is antithetical to law and order. The U.S. Supreme Court supports an Executive Order rescinding Obama's DACA orders. Nothing more.

Once upon a time, you seemed concerned about these issues, and about putting America first. As the Supreme Court began oral arguments for the case in November 2019, you tweeted "Many of the people in DACA, no longer very young, are far from angels. Some are tough hardened criminals."

We thank our Founding Fathers for a Constitution that allows us to address you and we thank you for battling each day for our nation. We insist that you stand strong by rescinding DACA and never giving in to the open-border demagogues. I thank you from the bottom of my heart for your sacrifices and will continue to include you in my daily prayers.
