According to a new Zogby poll, H.R. 4437 provides the immigration solution most Americans want.

I support the House's enforcement-only approach of H.R. 4437 and oppose Senate proposals to "legalize" illegal aliens and double annual immigration from one to two million.

A new Zogby poll shows that I'm not alone. It shows that when given a choice between the House and Senate approaches, the public prefers the House approach by more than a two-to-one margin (64 percent to 30 percent).

These findings suggest that Democratic support for a doubling of annual legal immigration and legalization of illegal aliens could jeopardize the Party. Please support an enforcement-only approach to immigration reform.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
