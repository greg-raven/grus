It is important that only American workers benefit from any jobs encouraged by the economic stimulus package. Please ensure that the two E-Verify amendments approved by the House of Representatives are in Senate version of American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009.

The House of Representatives approved, without any objection, two amendments to the stimulus package that concern E-Verify. The first reauthorizes the program for a further five years and the second mandates its use by any business that receives stimulus money. Given that more than 11 million Americans are out of work, I urge you to ensure that the Senate version of the stimulus bill has these American worker protections.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
