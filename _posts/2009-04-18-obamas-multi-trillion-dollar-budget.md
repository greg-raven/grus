Fiscal irresponsibility and massive new deficits are not solutions to our economic problems.

The budget you propose represents nearly two trillion dollars in tax hikes, much of which is directed at small business.

Your budget means bigger government, and bigger government always translates into less freedom.

For these reasons, I, as a legal U.S. citizen urge you to take back your $3.6 trillion budget and instead cut the size of the Federal government and the Federal budget by at least three-quarters.
