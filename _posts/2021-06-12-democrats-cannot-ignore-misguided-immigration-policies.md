Biden's asylum expansion plan will turbocharge the border crisis.

I was disappointed to read in the New York Times this past Memorial Day that the Biden administration plans to extend asylum to every victim of domestic violence in the world. That is not the appropriate application of asylum, nor is it practical – or responsible – to float the idea during a record migration surge at the border.

America cannot take in the world. Resident Biden's plan could spark an historic humanitarian crisis. Democrats in Congress can't remain silent.

What will you do to urge the administration to close asylum loopholes and restore confidence in our immigration system?
