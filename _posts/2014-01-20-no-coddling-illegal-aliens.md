Why are House Republican leadership aides telling reporters that your party is planning a push to give illegal aliens work permits? I hope this isn't true.

The Wall Street Journal is reporting:

> "Legislation is being developed by House Republicans that wouldn't exclude citizenship for those here illegally. But it rejects what many Republicans see as a 'special path' not available to would-be immigrants who didn't break the law."

According to *The New York Times:*

> "Between 4.4 million and 6.5 million immigrants illegally in the United States could gain an eventual pathway to citizenship under proposals being discussed by Republicans in the House of Representatives, according to an estimate published Tuesday by the National Foundation for American Policy, a nonpartisan research group in Washington."

Illegal aliens should not be rewarded. Period. They should not be allowed to stay in the country. They should not be given welfare. They should not be given Medicare. They should not be coddled in any way.

In 2010, CBS Evening News reported what everyone knows to be the case:

> "Officers say thousands of immigrants and smugglers still cross the border illegally into Arizona every day. They commit a disproportionate amount of crime. Illegal immigrants are just seven percent of Arizona's population,but make up nearly 15 percent of the state's prison population. They represent 14 percent of all inmates jailed for manslaughter and murder, and 24 percent of inmates on drug charges ..."

Legalizing criminals does NOT make our country more safe, and in fact does not benefit us in any way.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
