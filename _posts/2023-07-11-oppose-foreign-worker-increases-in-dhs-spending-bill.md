I was disturbed to learn that the House of Representatives is planning to proceed with the FY 2024 DHS Appropriations Bill, H.R. 4367! This legislation, if passed and signed into law, would harm hundreds of thousands of less-educated and lower-skilled American workers and their families.

The bill would remove the requirement that H-2A workers fill only temporary and seasonal positions, meaning that all industries would have an unlimited supply of cheap imported labor. The legislation would also exempt returning H-2B workers from the yearly cap. In normal years, this would result in a quadrupling of the yearly cap. However, due to “one-time” increases to the yearly cap in each of the previous three years, the FY 2024 appropriations bill would effectively sextuple the statutory cap.

The DHS Appropriations Bill must be opposed when the House votes on its passage. There are millions of less-educated, lower-skilled, and low-wage workers streaming across the U.S./Mexico border and the current administration is doing all it can to give each one of them work authorization. U.S. businesses simply do not need additional labor.

Passing the appropriations bill with these provisions will only make it more difficult for vulnerable Americans to find work. Please vote NO and convince your colleagues to do the same.

Sincerely,
