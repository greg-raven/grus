I cannot understand why you and your Republican colleagues haven’t passed any legislation to help end the border crisis. Republicans won control of the House by promising to end the crisis and it’s time for you to make it happen. Total encounters at the U.S./Mexico border exceeded 150,000 in January and February and apprehensions of illegal border crossers have exceeded 125,000 for 24 straight months; it’s clear that this problem isn’t going away.

In addition to passing legislation to secure the border and provide additional resources to USCPB and the Border Patrol, the House must pass legislation that closes asylum loopholes, mandates use of the E-Verify system, and reduces the Biden Administration’s ability to parole illegal aliens. In particular, asylum reform is required so that illegal economic migrants can’t game the system and mandating E-Verify remove the jobs magnet that attracts illegal aliens searching for work.

The American people are counting on you and your colleagues to finally take the border crisis seriously --- please don’t let us down.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. Make E-Verify mandatory.
