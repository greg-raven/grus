The federal government is giving illegal aliens a temporary stay from deportation, but states are responsible for deciding whether they will get driver's licenses or other taxpayer-funded benefits. I hope you will follow the lead of Governors in Mississippi and Arizona and issue an executive order that prevents them from accessing any public benefit.

The Secretary of Homeland Security does not have the legal or constitutional authority to bypass Congress and the American people to grant deferred-action status and work permits to illegal aliens. Yet that is exactly what she did on August 15th.

We do not know how many will get deferred action in our state, but those that do will seek driver's licenses, which make it easier to hold jobs. I see no reason to compound the problems the feds have created by giving illegal aliens licenses, especially since they will be competing for scarce jobs with under- or unemployed citizens.

It's also wrong to offer these illegal aliens public benefits. The more benefits they take, the less benefits there are for Americans in need.

Voters like me need your help now! Please study the executive orders released by the Arizona and Mississippi governors and issue one that protects the citizens of our state.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. If we do not observe the rule of law our nation is lost.
