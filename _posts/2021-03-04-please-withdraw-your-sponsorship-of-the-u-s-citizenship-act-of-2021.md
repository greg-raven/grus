I'm disappointed to learn that you want to double immigration.

The U.S. Citizenship Act would more than double immigration and issue green cards to more than 37 million new permanent job seekers from abroad, not counting the work permits that would be granted to illegal workers.

In the middle of a pandemic and economic crisis, the border is becoming more chaotic by the day, but we aren't seeing any solutions from Washington D.C. In fact, the U.S. Citizenship Act that you co-sponsored further aggravates the problem.

This immigration bill benefits unscrupulous employers who hire illegally, illegal border crossers and visa overstays, and human smugglers who profit every time America demonstrates that we don't take our own immigration laws seriously.

I didn't vote for this, and I'd like you to withdraw your co-sponsorship from the U.S. Citizenship Act.
