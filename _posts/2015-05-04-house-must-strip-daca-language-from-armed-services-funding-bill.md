I cannot understand how the House Armed Services Committee — a committee on which you serve — voted to endorse the DACA amnesty as part of the NDAA. Please make sure the military amnesty amendments are not in the final bill.

President Obama, in granting legal status and work permits to various classes of illegal aliens, acted outside the law and encroached on Congress’ authority over immigration policy. The Gallego amendment to the NDAA was not a vote to strengthen the military, it was a vote to legitimize the president’s DACA amnesty. Congress should not be voting to support any executive amnesty, especially during an Armed Services markup — it’s a disgrace to our men and women in uniform.

The Secretary of Defense already has authority under Title 10 of U.S. Code to waive enlistment requirements when it is appropriate to do so. This vote did nothing to improve our military and only serves to reward illegal aliens and encourage future waves of illegal immigration.

Congress cannot endorse the president’s actions; doing so will only encourage him to continue to sidestep Congress and act outside the law. Please make sure this amendment is not in the final bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. You PROMISED you would fight amnesty and illegal immigration after the elections, and then you do this? Illegal aliens didn’t elect you, American citizens did, and you need to uphold your oath of office and serve them, instead of criminal foreign invaders.
