We hope you will support H.R. 6165, The Responsible Child Tax Credit Eligibility Verification Act of 2012, so that illegal aliens will no longer be able to claim the child tax credit.

According to a new report on illegal-alien tax fraud, there are some illegal aliens who are claiming tax credits for up to 20 children, most of which don't even live with them in the United States. One illegal alien received a tax return of nearly $30,000! I don't understand how Congress can just sit back and watch this happen. Even the Inspector General for the U.S. Treasury Department was interviewed for the report, and he said he's warned the IRS about this for years.

It's bad enough that the federal government's failure to enforce our immigration laws has resulted in other taxpayer-funded services for illegal aliens like education, healthcare, and other public services. Now, Congress is allowing illegal aliens to take advantage of our tax system too!

H.R. 6165 would eliminate this loophole. Please make sure The Responsible Child Tax Credit Eligibility Verification Act of 2012 is passed as soon as possible.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
