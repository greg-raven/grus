I am disappointed by your tendency to support amnesty legislation! Why would you support legislation that harms the job prospects of disabled Americans?

At times in the past you have shown a willingness to stand up for the interests of illegal aliens and their unscrupulous employers over the rights of less-educated Americans. There are more than 12 million unemployed Americans, but yet 7.7 million illegal aliens have jobs. This is unconscionable and your previous stance on illegal immigration is partially to blame.

While the current economic situation has made life tough for all Americans, it has been particularly merciless toward disabled Americans. The Labor Departmentâ€™s Office of Disability Employment Policy released the first unemployment data on Americans with disabilities and the numbers are startling and disheartening: 13.2% of disabled Americans are unemployed --- a number 59% higher than the national average.

Hopefully the very fact that 13.2% of disabled Americans are unemployed will encourage you to rethink your position on amnesty. Any amnesty would likely keep many of these unemployed disabled Americans from ever finding a job, thereby negating their dreams of obtaining employment under the Americans with Disabilities Act.

I urge you to support legislation that helps unemployed Americans, not harm them. Tens of millions of unemployed Americans are depending on you --- a disproportionate number of whom are disabled.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
