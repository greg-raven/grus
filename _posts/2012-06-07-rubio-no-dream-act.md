Senator Marco Rubio:

It is downright appalling that you are working on a DREAM Act amnesty. There is no difference between giving illegal aliens citizenship and giving them an amnesty. They would still be able to compete against unemployed Americans for jobs! You need to drop this immediately and stop promoting it on Fox News!  
  
It is particularly irresponsible to talk about an amnesty for anybody while you have done nothing to reduce the number of Green Cards given out each year to new permanent foreign workers. We have 20 million Americans who can’t find a full-time job, and you are looking for a way to add hundreds of thousands of illegal aliens to the legal labor pool? Whom exactly do you represent?

You need to get with the program and end your flirtation with the DREAM Act amnesty. No good can come from it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
