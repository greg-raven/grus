Representative Jerry Lewis,

Iâ€™m writing to ask you to reach out to Rep. Kevin McCarthy from Bakersfield, to remind him that he swore an oath of office to protect and defend the United States. This oath of office includes representing the interests of U.S. citizens, not those of illegal aliens ... no matter what the pretext.  
  
We need E-Verify now, and Rep. McCarthy needs to get on board.

I would much appreciate it if there is anything you can do to get him to represent law-abiding American citizens instead of foreign criminals.

Thanks,

Greg Raven
