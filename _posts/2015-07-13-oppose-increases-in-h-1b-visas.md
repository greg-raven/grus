A recent *New York Times* report highlights the stories of laid-off tech workers who have been forced to train their foreign-worker, H-1B replacements. I urge you to oppose increases in H-1B visas and instead help stop this ongoing and disturbing trend.

The Times' story focuses on last year's lay-offs at Walt Disney World in Orlando and reports that the laid-off workers were forced to train their replacements as a condition of their severance package. This story is disturbingly similar to reports from California where Southern California Edison did the same.

Ironically, Disney President Robert Iger, responsible for the recent lay-offs, has helped form the Partnership for a New American Economy that calls for more H-1B visas in light of supposed high-tech worker shortages.

Yet, some Members of Congress join Iger's calls and insist that we have a shortage of high-tech workers. I urge you to ignore these calls and instead work to put American tech workers ahead of foreign tech workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
