No more amnesties! Please oppose Sen. Specter's immigration proposal because it includes a major amnesty.

Did you know that an estimated 6.7 million illegal aliens who were employed as of Jan. 1, 2004, plus an estimated 3.5 million non-working spouses and minor children could qualify for amnesty under the Specter plan? They will be allowed to stay indefinitely as long as they don't do anything to get themselves deported.

Please be sure you have all of the facts straight before you vote on the Specter immigration plan. You may be supporting the largest amnesty in U.S. history without even knowing it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. I don't know why Bush and other so-called leaders are attempting to destroy our country, but please don't join them. Protect the borders and eject the illegals Now.
