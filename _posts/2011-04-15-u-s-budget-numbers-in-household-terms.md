The budget explained in simple English.

I love it when complex things are simplified so that we can all understand.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>United States Tax revenue:</td> <td>$2,170,000,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Fed budget:</td> <td>$3,820,000,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>New debt:</td> <td>$1,650,000,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>National debt:</td> <td>$14,271,000,000,000</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Recent budget cut:</td> <td>$38,500,000,000</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Now, remove 8 zeros and pretend it's a household budget.

<table>
	<tr>
		<td>Annual family income:</td> <td>$21,700</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Money the family spent:</td> <td>$38,200</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>New debt on the credit card:</td> <td>$16,500</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Outstanding balance on credit card:</td> <td>$142,710</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>Total budget cuts which some politicians are proud about:</td> <td>$385</td>
	</tr>
</table>

Stop the insanity now. Vote them out and demand a balanced budget.
