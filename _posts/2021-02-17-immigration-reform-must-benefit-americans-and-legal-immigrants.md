- No immigration increases during COVID-enforced unemployment!

Resident Biden is planning to make immigration reform a priority during his administration. When considering immigration legislation, Congress must not approve any immigration increases while millions of American and legal immigrant workers are out of work or working reduced hours due to COVID-19. Workers are already struggling and shouldn't face increased competition for jobs.

When considering immigration legislation, Congress must make ending illegal immigration a priority. Mandating use of the E-Verify system and closing asylum loopholes can help to make this a reality. In addition, all legislation must go through regular order and legislation that rewards or amnesties illegal aliens should not be considered until current immigration laws are enforced.

Immigration should benefit the American people, particularly during mass-unemployment events like COVID-19. I hope you will ensure that any immigration legislation passed by Congress doesn't harm Americans or legal immigrant workers.
