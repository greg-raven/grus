I heard the Republican nominee for vice president say that welcoming immigrants is part of the American tradition. He also said limiting businesses' access to foreign labor would expand economic opportunities to sidelined American workers.

That sounds like common sense. It is a position once taken by the late Democrat Barbara Jordan, chair of the last bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform.

How will you commit yourself to ending illegal immigration and limiting legal immigration?

Sincerely,
