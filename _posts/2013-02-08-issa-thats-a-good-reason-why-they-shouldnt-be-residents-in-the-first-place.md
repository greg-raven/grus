Representative Darrell Issa:

We are disappointed by your decision to support an amnesty for illegal aliens. California is being ravaged by illegal immigration and I hope you will rethink your decision to support it.  
  
I agree that we shouldn’t have a "class of residents that will never be offered an opportunity for citizenship." This is exactly why illegal aliens should never be rewarded with permanent residency. These individuals broke the law to come to the United States and the last thing we should do is reward them with an amnesty. This would only encourage more people to come to the U.S. illegally.

Instead of saying that an amnesty is alright with you, you should be working to ending illegal immigration. You should be working to mandate use of the E-Verify system, implement the entry/exit system, and secure the border. Until these measures are in place, no rewards for illegal aliens can even be discussed.

Please stop talking about amnestying illegal aliens, It only makes it less likely that they’ll leave.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Mr. Greg Raven

P.S. Send them back to their countries of origin. Then, they won’t be residents. If "leaders" such as yourself were upholding your oath of office, we wouldn’t have this problem in the first place. Remove the invaders, and secure our borders!
