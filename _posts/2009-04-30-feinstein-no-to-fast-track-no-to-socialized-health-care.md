I'm outraged by Congress's use of procedural trickery to put socialized healthcare on the fast-track in the Obama revised budget!

This maneuver is classic political misdirection that silences the opposition, and will ultimately result in the passage of a bevy of socialistic programs. Congress should not use the reconciliation process for the budget and for big-ticket items such as socialized healthcare. Muzzling debate and allowing Congress to work behind-the-scenes unchallenged and away from public scrutiny is simply not the way to do business!

I urge you to take a strong stand against the so-called fast-track measures being employed to keep the public in the dark on these vital issues!
