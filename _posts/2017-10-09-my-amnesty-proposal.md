While I appreciate your 70-point immigration proposal, I have to say I am still opposed to any amnesty for Dreamers or anyone else currently here illegally.

At the very most, I would support an "amnesty" that removes them from the country without prejudicing their ability later to apply for citizenship through normal, legal channels --- that is, at the back of the line --- after they repay the treasury for any and all food, housing, schooling, medical, taxes, etc., and pay a nominal fee (say $5,000) for all the trouble they have caused us. That is, they get "amnesty" only after indemnifying American taxpayers for accrued costs.

Obviously, this "amnesty" would only apply to those who have committed no (as in zero) further crimes while illegally in the United States.

Don't let them do to you what they did to Reagan, et al.
