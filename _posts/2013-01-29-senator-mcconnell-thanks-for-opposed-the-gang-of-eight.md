Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell:

I am glad that you, the Senate Minority Leader, are speaking out against the Gang of Eight’s terrible immigration proposal. How would an amnesty help the American people?  
  
The proponents of the 1986 amnesty bill claimed that workplace verification would be instituted as a result of the bill. The American people bought this promise and were duly hoodwinked. The 1996 immigration reform bill required an entry/exit system to be put in place. Sadly, we’re still waiting for that system.

Nothing can happen as far as giving illegal aliens any "pathway to legalization" until E-Verify is mandated, there is a entry/exit system in place, and the border is truly secure. Until that time, there can be no amnesty.

Thank you again for doing what is best for the United States and please continue to use your leadership position to oppose amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
