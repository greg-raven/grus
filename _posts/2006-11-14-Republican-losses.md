Some newspaper editorial writers have tried to spin the Republicans' loss of the House of Representatives as proof that getting tough on illegal immigration is a political loser, but nothing could be further from the truth.

If getting tough on illegal immigration was such a political loser this election, why did members of the Immigration Reform Caucus fare better than Republicans in general? 11.5 percent of Republican seats were lost in the Democratic wave, but only 6.7 percent of the Members of the IRC lost their seats. 

The House Republicans were the only force that stopped President Bush and the Senate from passing a massive amnesty. They were not punished for that act. In fact, Republicans probably would have fared much better if President Bush had been more supportive of their immigration initiatives. 

Don't let the media-bias fool you. A majority of American voters still approve of the House's Attrition Through Enforcement solution to illegal immigration.

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
