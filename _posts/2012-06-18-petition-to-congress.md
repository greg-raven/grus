I am writing to demand that Congress protect American jobs and the Rule of Law by passing the H.A.L.T. Act — (H.R. 2497). This act is designed to protect America from the Obama Administration’s disastrous Amnesty plans.  
  
We want our jobs back. We want the Rule of Law back. We want our Republic back.

And we DO NOT want President Obama’s back door Amnesty plans!

Pass the H.A.L.T. Act today!

Sincerely,

Greg Raven
