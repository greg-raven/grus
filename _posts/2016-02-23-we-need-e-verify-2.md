Perhaps the biggest magnet for illegal immigration to the United States is jobs. Most illegal aliens come to our country in seek of work, and considering that 40% of the illegal-alien population came here legally and simply overstayed their visa, border security is not enough to stop illegal immigration. That's why I urge you to support legislation that would require all employers to use the E-Verify employment verification system and ensure that they're only hiring authorized workers.

Not only would an E-Verify mandate require employers to run new hires through the system, but it would gently move illegal aliens out of U.S. jobs, freeing them up for legal workers. According to data from Pew Hispanic Research, approximately 7 million illegal aliens hold non-agricultural jobs in the United States.

In 2013, E-Verify checked the worker eligibility for nearly 24 million new hires, and 98.81 percent of them received authorization to work within 24 hours. Furthermore, according to a survey of E-Verify users, 92 percent found the system to be effective and 89 percent said it was highly accurate. It's also proven to be extremely popular with an 86% customer satisfaction rate.

As you can see, E-Verify is popular with employers and would be the single greatest deterrent in reducing illegal immigration. I urge you to support legislation that would require all employers to use it.

Sincerely,

Greg Raven
