It has been a painful few months hearing about the humanitarian crisis at the border, and I want to believe that you have good intentions. However, this feeling is fading in light of the poor decisions you are making with your immigration policies. Iâ€™m very hopeful that you will get things back on track and keep immigration out of the budget reconciliation bill.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders and evict those already here illegally.
