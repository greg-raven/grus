It has been a painful few months hearing about the humanitarian crisis at the border, and I want to believe that you have good intentions. However, this feeling is fading in light of the poor decisions you are making with your immigration policies. I'm very hopeful that you will get things back on track and keep immigration out of the budget reconciliation bill.

P.S. Secure our borders and evict those already here illegally.
