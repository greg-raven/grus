I am disappointed that some of your Senate colleagues are pushing for an increase in H-2B numbers. As H-2B visas typically cover seasonal, entry-level, or unskilled jobs, these visas disproportionately harm young Americans. Increasing H-2B visa numbers would prevent thousands of more young Americans from entering the workplace.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly half of all working-age Americans with less than a high school degree are out of work. Itâ€™s these American workers who directly compete with H-2B visa holders for jobs.

Please do all you can to make sure that these visa numbers are not increased
