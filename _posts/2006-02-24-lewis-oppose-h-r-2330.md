Supporting H.R. 2330 suggests that one supports amnesty for illegal aliens. If that is not the case, I suggest you keep your name off this amnesty bill.

Supporters of the Kolbe/Flake/Guitierrez amnesty seem to believe that the estimated 11 million illegal aliens currently in the U.S. are not enough and that we need to create another incentive for illegal immigration.

By holding out the reward of jobs and permanent resident status to illegal aliens already here, the Kolbe/Flake/Guitierrez amnesty invites even more illegal immigration. Former INS data show that the massive IRCA amnesty in 1986 actually increased illegal immigration, rather than slowing it as originally planned. There is no reason to think that this amnesty will not have the exact same effect as the 7 previous amnesties Congress has passed since 1986.

Isn't it time that we learn from our mistakes and begin to pursue policies that will actually deter illegal immigration? These would include mandatory workplace verification and increased cooperation between state and local law enforcement and federal immigration officials.

Please consider legislation that would increase interior enforcement rather than H.R. 2330 to reward illegal immigration.
