While we do wish to secure the border, secure the workplace, and mandate use of the E-Verify system, passing any immigration legislation while the Senate's mass amnesty bill is still active would give the Senate the vehicle it needs to pass a mass amnesty. Please share this message with the GOP Leadership who is considering bringing this legislation to the floor for a vote.  
  
Pro-amnesty Senators have been unabashed in their determination to use any House-passed immigration bill to force their amnesty onto the American people. If the House does pass any immigration legislation, the Senate intends on attaching their "Gang of Eight" amnesty bill to it in the resulting conference committee. I know you don't want this to happen.

I know you oppose amnesty and don't want to put millions of Americans permanently out of work or ride roughshod over the rule of law. I'm not asking you to oppose genuinely good immigration bills, just oppose Speaker Boehner holding votes on these bills while the Senate bill is active.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this

P.S. No amnesty. Not no way, not no how!
