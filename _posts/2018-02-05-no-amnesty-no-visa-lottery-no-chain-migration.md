Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Chris Coons (D-Del.) have introduced legislation to amnesty "Dreamers" (not just DACA recipients), while only providing money for a border security study. This is clearly unacceptable. It is vital that we enforce our immigration laws, with means DACA recipients and "Dreamers" have to go.

The next item on the agenda is to reform our immigration laws so that they serve the American people. That means ending chain migration and the visa lottery, while ensuring our southern border is secured, and lowering overall immigration from whatever source.
