I was heartened by the results of a new poll, which found that likely American voters overwhelmingly want to reform our immigration system to serve the national interest and work for the American people by ending Chain Migration.

Pulse Opinion Research asked likely voters, "If Congress decides to pass a bill to give young-adult ILLEGAL immigrants lifetime work permits and a path to citizenship, should the bill allow illegal immigrants to petition to obtain lifetime work permits for their extended families, or should the bill include an end to Chain Migration of extended families?"

By nearly a 2-to-1 margin, likely voters chose, "Include an end to Chain Migration of extended families." This is incredibly important and shows that the American people understand our immigration system needs to change for the twenty-first century.

The poll also asked at what level immigration to the U.S. should be kept and 60% of likely voters said that 500,000 people or fewer should be given green cards each year. Much of that can be accomplished by simply ending Chain Migration and the Visa Lottery.

It's clear that the American people --- and American voters --- want our immigration system changed. Congress should not amnesty DACA recipients without ending chain migration and mandating the use of the E-Verify system. In addition, Congress must consider reducing immigration levels to a more sustainable level of fewer than 500,000 per year.
