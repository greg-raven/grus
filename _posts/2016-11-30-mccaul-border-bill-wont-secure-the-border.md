In recent days, I’ve heard House GOP Leaders talk about using Rep. Michael McCaul’s border bill, H.R. 399, as a starting point for immigration reform. I don’t support this bill, and President-elect Donald Trump already has the authorization he needs to secure the border through existing legislation.

Rep. McCaul’s H.R. 399 won’t do anything to secure the border. It would reduce the amount of double-layered fencing that’s already required under existing federal law. It would allow up to 7 years for the completion of the biometric entry/exit system that was first passed by Congress in 1996. And it wouldn’t force the executive branch to end lax enforcement efforts, such as catch-and-release, along the border.

The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 authorizes the Trump Administration to do whatever it takes to gain operational control of the Southern border, including the construction of a wall, and the Secure Fence Act of 2006 authorizes the Trump Administration to build a double-layered fence along 700 miles of the border.

Congress doesn’t need to take action to fulfill President-elect Trump’s promises to secure the border. Instead, Congress should focus its efforts on ending sanctuary cities and minimizing the hiring of illegal workers by requiring all employers to use E-Verify.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
