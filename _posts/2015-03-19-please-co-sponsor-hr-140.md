An op-ed in a recent edition of USA Today explains how birthright citizenship loopholes are exploited by illegal workers and tourists, and lead to more unemployed citizens and legal immigrant workers. I hope you will read this editorial and act to change the current unacceptable situation by cosponsoring Rep. Steve King’s H.R. 140.

Typically, the United States is a trailblazing country that is ahead of its time. We built the first airplane, put the first and only men on the moon, and were the first to split the atom. Americans were the first to develop the assembly line, the first to fly at the speed of sound, and the first to envision and create an organization for nations to settle their differences in a civil and peaceful manner. With all of these American firsts in mind, why is the United States the only industrialized nation to still grant citizenship to each and every individual born in the country, regardless of their parents’ legal status?

Within the past 20 years, nations such as Canada, Australia, and France have ended the practice of giving birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens. Clearly, the United States cannot lead the way on this issue, but we can catch up with the pack.

I hope you will support H.R. 140, the Birthright Citizenship Act of 2015, and help to correct this glaring oversight in out nation’s development.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
