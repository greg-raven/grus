It is disappointing that a reputable company such as IBM would post jobs that preferred temporary foreign workers over U.S. citizens. How are American tech workers, like me, supposed to find work? Please make sure that IBM is forced to hire jobless Americans by reducing, not increasing, foreign worker numbers.

Despite IBM preferring less-expensive temporary foreign workers for nearly four years, they were only forced to pay the government $44,400 in civil penalties to avoid trial. During this time, IBM hired thousands of H-1B workers and lobbied Congress for the right to bring in thousands more. It's clear that this once proud American corporation doesn't care about helping American tech workers, it only cares about its bottom line.

For example, IBM posted software engineering positions in Atlanta and Boise that require Indian work authorization. Obviously this requirement excluded nearly all American tech workers but included all Indian H-1B workers. This is blatant discrimination against American workers and few in Congress seem to care.

Please act against the practice of hiring low-cost foreign workers at the expense of American workers. Far too many American tech workers are either unemployed or working outside their field.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
