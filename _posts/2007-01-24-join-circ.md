I believe immigration levels are too high. I hope you will support the Immigration Reform Caucus in their effort to achieve sensible immigration policies.

The late Barbara Jordan, chair of the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, called for lower immigration levels to fight economic injustice because mass immigration harms America's most vulnerable workers and their families the most. 

The Congressional Immigration Reform Caucus is working to implement the recommendations of the Jordan Commission. 

Becoming a member of the Caucus is a way to show that you are taking the lead in working to protect the wages of all American workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
