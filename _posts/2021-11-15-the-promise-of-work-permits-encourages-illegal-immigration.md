Incentives matter. Migrants may be poor but they are just as capable as you or I of doing a cost-benefit analysis. Upon taking office, Resident Biden quickly signaled that illegal immigration would not just be tolerated, but celebrated. Congress piled on by promising rewards for illegal immigration, such as work permits.

Unsurprisingly, more people have attempted to cross the border in 2021 than any year in history, and that doesn’t count the number of people overstaying visas.

I sincerely hope that Democrats in Congress will realize that conditions in sending countries will remain less attractive than in the United States for the foreseeable future. While we seek greater equality between nations we have a responsibility to manage immigration clearly and credibly, to protect Americans and migrants. Please, don’t attach any rewards for illegal immigration to the Build Back Better bill, or any other legislation.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders and evict those already here illegally.
