It is disappointing that so many employers are willing to hire illegal aliens instead of unemployed Americans or legal immigrants. The New IDEA Act, H.R. 1292, would put a stop to this. Please cosponsor this common-sense legislation today!

While 22 million Americans are unable to find a full-time job, 7 million illegal aliens work non-agricultural jobs --- jobs in construction, manufacturing, and the service industries, just to name a few. Not only are crooked employers able to pay these illegal workers less, they get tax breaks for doing so. The New Idea Act would change that.

The legislation works by clarifying that the wages and benefits paid to illegal aliens are not tax deductible. This means that when the IRS determines an employee is illegal, the business expense for the illegal employee will be denied and will instead be taxable income. As a result, an illegal alien that is paid $10 per hour by an unscrupulous employer suddenly costs the employer $16 per hour.

On top of this, it gives employers "safe harbor" if they use E-Verify program, which makes sure that the employment documents used when hiring are valid and identity lawful workers.

I know you care about unemployed Americans as much as I do. Please cosponsor the New IDEA Act today.
