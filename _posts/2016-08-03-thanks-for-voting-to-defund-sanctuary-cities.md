Thank you for voting in favor of the Gosar amendment to the Financial Services Appropriations bill. Please continue to support legislation that targets sanctuary cities.

Countless lives have been lost because illegal aliens who should have been in ICE custody or deported were sheltered by sanctuary localities. Even though these localities have blood on their hands, they still refuse to take steps to make sure criminal illegal aliens are turned over to ICE for deportation proceedings. I am glad that you and your colleagues have voted to prevent sanctuary cities from continuing to flout the law.

Thank you again for voting to defund sanctuary cities. Please continue to support legislation that prevents localities from protecting criminal aliens.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven, Apple Valley, CA
