I am very disturbed by Leader Schumer's speech in front of the Capitol on November 16th, in which he said "We have a population that is not reproducing on its own with the same level that it used to. The only way we're going to have a great future is if we welcome immigrants ... get a path to citizenship for all 11 million \[illegal immigrants\]."

What he is describing is a Ponzi scheme in which America's biodiversity is destroyed by perpetual population growth, driven by federal immigration policy, so that the U.S. government can privatize the profit and socialize the costs of ensuring a labor surplus for the investment class. That may please your corporate donors, but Democrats must do better than selling out the environment and disadvantaged workers.
