I hope I can count on you to support legislation that requires all employers to use E-Verify. With 15 million Americans unable to find a full-time job and millions more suffering from the ramifications of a stolen identity, passing E-Verify is the single best action you can take to end illegal hiring and turn off the jobs magnet.

Requiring employers to run new hires through the Chamber of Commerce-supported E-Verify system, would gently move illegal aliens out of U.S. jobs. Over time, the 7 million illegal aliens in non-agricultural jobs would be replaced by unemployed Americans and legal immigrants. While not solving Americaâ€™s unemployment or illegal immigration problems, mandatory E-Verify would certainly lessen their severity.

Clearly, this is an easy and effective way of putting unemployed Americans and legal immigrants in jobs currently held by illegal aliens while also shutting off the jobs magnet that lures so many to come to the U.S. illegally.

Phone me if you want to talk about this.
