Did you know that 88 percent of all employment growth over the last five years went to immigrants? Or that 60 percent of employment growth among immigrants went to illegal workers?

That's what the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics' first study to reflect the record illegal immigration wave indicates. You won't find a better data point to explain why immigration was such a big issue in the 2024 election. Immigration at this level is masking the deteriorated economic mobility of millions of Americans. The downstream effects of low labor-force participation include crime and deaths of despair. 

It is the responsibility of this Congress to reduce immigration to levels that can sustain the American dream for all Americans. Additionally, Congress must secure the workplace with E-Verify.
