Thank you for voting for the Verify First Act. It is ridiculous that anyone could oppose legislation preventing illegal aliens from receiving taxpayer-funded tax credits. Benefits such as these encourage illegal aliens to come to the U.S. in the first place.

I hope you will continue to support legislation that dissuades illegal aliens from coming to the United States and will do all you can to secure the border and make sure our immigration laws are enforced.
