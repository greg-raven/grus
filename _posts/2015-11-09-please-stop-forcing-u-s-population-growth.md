The population of the United States is on track to hit 444 million by 2050. Please reflect on your policies that are causing this detrimental and unsustainable growth.

Until the 1970s, the United States admitted about 250,000 immigrants each year. This policy helped make this country a great nation. However, Congress' decision to allow immigration to spiral out of control has created an unsustainable situation.

Currently, around 1 million legal immigrants and 700,000 illegal aliens come to the United States each year. If Congress does not act to reform immigration, America's population will reach 444 million by 2050.

Immigration helped make America what it is today. However, it is possible to have too much of a good thing. Please work to reduce immigration to more sustainable levels.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
