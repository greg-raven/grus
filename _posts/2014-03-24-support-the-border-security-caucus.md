Rep. Lamar Smith has started the House Border Security Caucus. I know you agree with its aims, so I hope you will join.

Securing the border is crucial to stopping the flow of illegal aliens and keeping our nation safe. However, the members of the caucus realize that border security doesn't stop at the border: what happens in the interior impacts what happens at the border. Immigration laws need to be enforced in the interior so that fewer people try to come to the U.S. illegally.

The workplace needs to be secured. In addition to dissuading further illegal immigration, this would help get Americans back to work. A biometric entry/exit system needs to be put in place so we know who is in the country legally and who has overstayed his/her visa. The laws already on the books need to be enforced so that illegal aliens know they will be arrested and deported.

This is what the House Border Security Caucus wants to achieve. Please tell Rep. Lamar Smith you want to join.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
