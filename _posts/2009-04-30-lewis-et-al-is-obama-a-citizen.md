There are serious questions about whether or not Barack Obama is eligible to be (or act as) President of the United States. I urge you to look into this questions. Here are some of the documents you will need in order to get to the bottom of this Constitutional crisis:

1. long form birth certificate (NOT a "Certificate of Live Birth");
2. adoption records;
3. education records (including transcripts showing nationality and scholarships);
4. health records;
5. selective service records;
6. passport records (including any foreign passports he might have used);
7. social security records )including disclosure of all social security numbers he has used)

This is so important that I request that you put aside any and all other business before you and resolve it immediately.

Sincerely,
