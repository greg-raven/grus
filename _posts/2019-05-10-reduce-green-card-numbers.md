We do need more enforcement, but we also need to reduce green card numbers!

I was concerned by reports that your immigration plan wonâ€™t reduce immigration numbers, especially considering a recent Harvard-Harris poll shows that American voters want immigration numbers reduced. The poll found that:

- 81% want immigration reduced from its current level of 1 million;
- 68% support ending the visa lottery; and
- 60% support ending chain migration.

Reducing the number of green cards issued each year would tighten the labor market and increase wages for workers across all industries, especially for those who have not seen wage growth since the end of the great recession.

American voters and workers want immigration reduced; I hope you will take steps to make it happen.
