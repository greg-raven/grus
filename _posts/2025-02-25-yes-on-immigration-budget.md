The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on H. Con. Res. 14, the House's budget resolution, tomorrow. The budget resolution sets budgets and priorities for the next ten years; once passed by both the House and Senate, individual committees will determine how the money is allocated. The resolution currently before the House allocates an additional $200 billion for border and interior immigration enforcement.

Please vote YES on this budget resolution to fully fund President Trump's immigration and border enforcement priorities.
