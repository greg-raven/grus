I was disturbed to read in the Washington Post that you are open to DACA legislation that only provides for border wall funding. Securing the border is a good first step, but it does nothing to end the jobs magnet and does nothing to stop people overstaying their visas. A wall will stop many from coming to this country illegally, but some will still get past it and many will continue to come to the U.S. legally and overstay their visas.

A DACA-for-border funding deal is a bad deal. Any DACA deal must end chain migration and the visa lottery and mandate use of the E-Verify system. There is no rush make a deal because several U.S. courts have stopped you ending the program.

I urge you to reconsider your willingness to make a DACA-for-border funding deal. There is no need to rush into a bad deal that doesn't solve our problems.
