It is the duty and responsibility of the President and Congress to enforce our immigration laws. I am opposed to any attempt to trade enforcement for amnesty for the so-called dreamers to compete and take jobs from Americans and those here legally. We tried this trade in 1986 and the result is the 12+ million illegal aliens currently in the United States. It didn't work then and it won't work now.

Additionally, any form of amnesty for "dreamers" would result in millions of additional illegal immigrants on top of those amnestied, as David Horowitz and others have so ably pointed out.

I join millions of others in urging you, Congress, and the President to put America, the rule of law, and American workers first and oppose this deal.

In fact, I urge you to oppose any amnesty ... period.
