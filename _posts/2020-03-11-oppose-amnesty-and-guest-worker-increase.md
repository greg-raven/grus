Oppose the Trump administrationâ€™s amnesty and guest worker expansion!

I cannot understand why the president and some Republican Members of Congress are planning to introduce legislation that would amnesty illegal aliens and expand guest worker programs for the construction and building trades. President Trump was elected on a promise to oppose amnesty, reduce immigration, and tighten profligate guest worker programs. Breaking this promise would destroy the trust of his voters and make his reelection far less likely. In addition, the Republican Party would find it difficult to keep control of the Senate and regain control of the House of Representatives.

I hope you, your Republican colleagues, and President Trump will not violate the trust that American voters have shown. Please do not support any legislation to amnesty illegal aliens or expand guest worker programs.
