During the past 20 years, America has lost more than 11.5 million acres to development. A majority of the loss was a result of the U.S. population growing by nearly 40 million people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our country is poised to add another 75 million people by 2060 --- with roughly 90% due to immigration.

There are plenty of downsides to our unsustainable growth. Every year, more and more Americans become city dwellers, where high-density living leads to traffic congestion, poor air quality, high housing costs and taxes, no starry nights, and little contact with the natural world.

We need leaders like you to change our nation's course from the relentless loss of open space to a sustainable future. Please support efforts that would reduce America's rapid population growth, namely legislation that would reduce immigration (e.g., stricter limits on chain migration).
