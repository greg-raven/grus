DACA recipients are still protected, and can work in US. In the meantime, the border remains open, and a record number of migrants are entering (and too often perishing) in the hope of getting jobs. Border enforcement, not DACA protections, must be Congress' priority.

In the last two years, there have been more apprehensions, more border deaths, and more border rescues than in any other two year period in history. People are coming because they hope to receive something like DACA themselves. This Congress needs to end the border crisis. Restore the Migrant Protection Protocols program.
