The new omnibus unveiled by the House Appropriations Committee calls for increases in the number of H-2B visas issued every year. I urge you to strip this provision out before it comes to the floor for a vote.

As H-2B visas typically cover seasonal, entry-level, or unskilled jobs, these visas disproportionately harm young Americans. Increasing H-2B visa numbers would prevent thousands more young Americans from entering the workplace.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly half of all working-age Americans with less than a high school degree are out of work. It's these American workers who directly compete with H-2B visa holders for jobs.

Investigative reports have shown that businesses are more than willing to fire American workers when H-2B workers become available. It's clear that the H-2B program, which is fraught with abuse, harms young Americans and should not be expanded when the current continuing resolution expires.

Please do all you can to protect these American workers by opposing any effort to increase H-2B visas.
