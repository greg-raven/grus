North America's bird populations are being pushed by us to the edge of extinction. Will you stand up to confront the elephant in the room?

According to a study released in Science Magazine, and reported in *The New York Times* ("The Crisis for Birds Is a Crisis for Us All"), North American wild bird populations have declined by 30%. Decades of record-level immigration have resulted in more people competing for more resources and birds (as well as other species) have paid the price.

As the Times article illustrates, there is an inverse relationship between human population growth and bird population decline.

I know that politicians prefer to avoid discussion about responsible immigration numbers, but we now know that silence has consequences. Let's show some courage before we lose another species.
