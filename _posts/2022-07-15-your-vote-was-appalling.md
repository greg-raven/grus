Gun Owners of America has just informed me that you voted against the right to bear arms by supporting the Active Shooter Alert Act. H.R. 6538 will lead to deceptive anti-gun propaganda under the guise of "awareness."

The fact you voted for it demonstrates you have little regard for gun owners and have no problem compromising my rights. This will be remembered in your next election when I go to vote or talk with the many other voters I know.
