The bipartisan Legal Workforce Act would phase in mandatory use of the E-Verify system, thereby preventing illegal aliens from finding work. The bill also contains provisions to combat identity theft. Please cosponsor it today!  
  
The Legal Workforce Act would not only require employers to run new hires through the free and easy to use E-Verify system, it notifies employers when a suspected stolen or fraudulent Social Security Number has been stolen or is being used. Once this happens, the employers are required to run the employee in question through the E-Verify system to help weed out illegal alien workers.

Simply put, this bill is an easy and cheap way of putting millions of Americans back to work. Please help combat ID theft and the hiring of illegal aliens by cosponsoring the Legal Workforce Act.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We must do everything possible to favor existing U.S. citizens and discourage foreigners --- especially illegal foreigners. A nation without borders is not a nation.
