Our country's growing population played a role in the fate of the 23 species that have now been declared extinct. You must wake up to the fact that our environment doesn't care about politics, and as long as Congress refuses to reduce immigration to a lower level, our population will continue to grow. This will thwart our ability to further protect threatened species and their habitats. I understand that this is a sensitive issue, but it is of utmost importance that prompt action is taken to maintain healthy ecosystems and biodiversity. This cannot be achieved if we constantly have to accommodate more people. Ninety percent of our projected population growth is due to immigration. You must reduce this number.

Sincerely,

P.S. Mass immigration is a weapon of mass destruction.
