For over 200 years, American policymakers have used immigration increases to pilfer the wealth of multiple generations of American Freedmen before it was even earned. With few notable exceptions, the calls of Black abolitionists and civil rights leaders to set immigration levels with the interests of American workers foremost in mind have been ignored.

At the very least, immigration policy should not be so unregulated as to disadvantage one of the oldest groups of American citizens: Black Americans. Restore our immigration system to a more honorable tradition by ending chain migration as recommended by the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform.
