I strongly urge you to vote "Yea" on the Safeguard American Voter Eligibility Act (SAVE Act) to require proof of citizenship to register to vote in federal elections. This bill will build public trust in election integrity, and remove a potentially powerful reward for illegal immigration. H.R. 22 has received bipartisan support in the past and is a commonsense response to widespread agreement among voters that proof of voting eligibility should be required to participate in federal elections.

Whatever your level of concern about illegal voting, the SAVE Act would ease public distress over the issue, and remove a potentially powerful reward for those who violate immigration laws.
