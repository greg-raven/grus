As a freedom-loving American, I strongly oppose the nomination of David Chipman for Director of the ATF.

Chipman was a career ATF agent who immediately turned to anti-gun activism after retiring. Chipman, at various times, worked for both Bloomberg and Giffords funded anti-gun campaigns and has been a staunch political activist for gun control. This makes him unqualified to lead an incredibly powerful law enforcement agency tasked with enforcing firearms law. The ATF Director should not seek to use this powerful position for partisan political activities.

I urge you to oppose Chipman in the strongest manner possible.
