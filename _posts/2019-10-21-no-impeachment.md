President Donald Trump was duly elected by the American people and it is far past time that Congress accept the results of the election and get back to doing the work of the American people.

The Constitution makes it clear that the Executive Branch is responsible for enforcing the law as President Trump, Rudy Giuliani, and Attorney General Barr were dutifully doing. I’m glad the administration is investigating what appears to be a textbook “pay for play” scheme used by the Biden Family and other members of the Obama administration. It would be negligent of the Trump administration if they didn’t investigate what appears to be blatant illegal activity involving members of the previous administration and foreign governments.

As one of your constituents, I want to make it clear that I strongly oppose the impeachment inquiry. This is a dramatic overreach to appease leftwingers who were breathlessly promised by your colleagues in Congress and the FakeNews that Mueller was going to put an abrupt end to the Trump Presidency. Should the Congress, with it’s single-digits popularity, actually succeed in removing our President from office, it would call into question the very legitimacy of our democratic Republic.

We have a national election in about a year and ‘We the People’ will decide whether or not to reelect President Trump. If you really want to get President Trump out of office, do it the American way, beat him at the polls.

Sincerely,

Mr. Greg Raven, Apple Valley, CA
