Our beautiful nation has become stricken with immigration-driven population growth even though most Americans want slower population growth. Urban sprawl, and the subsequent loss of community cohesion, will only worsen as our population continues to soar by millions every year. The Census Bureau predicts that the U.S. population will soar to 404 million by the Year 2060, with more than 90% due to immigration.

As America’s population grows, towns and cities also are becoming more densely populated, while houses are being razed to make way for large multi-unit buildings. But despite all these efforts to meet the housing demand, housing costs are rising out of reach while people are becoming more disconnected from their neighbors.

With illegal immigration now surpassing legal immigration, please work to end asylum and parole abuse, as well as supporting legislation such as limiting chain migration to spouses and minor children, and/or establishing a nationwide E-Verify system. This action is the best way to protect Americans’ housing choices.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. Make E-Verify mandatory.

Sincerely,
