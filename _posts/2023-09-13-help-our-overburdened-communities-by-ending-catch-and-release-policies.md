I urge you to work to end current catch-and-release policies.

It is appalling that 40% of migrants released by the Biden Administration never checked in. Another 40% never received a "notice to appear" at all.

82% of migrants released have not been entered into the court docket. Of the 18% who have been entered into the court docket, most will wait years before their case is heard --- most will lose, and almost none will face consequences if they refuse to leave when ordered.

Meanwhile, as more and more migrants are released, communities across the United States continue to be strained with providing housing and resources. For example, Massachusetts recently declared a state of emergency and is now forced to use hotels as emergency housing and ask residents to open their homes to migrants. New York City officials expect that its migrant influx will cost the city $12 billion over the next three years.

I urge you to support reforms to end catch-and-release. I also urge you to introduce a companion bill to the House-passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act. and cosponsor the E-Verify bill S. 156, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act.
