New analysis from Democratic political consultant David Shor indicates that Democrats do worse when they talk about their preferred immigration policies.

*The New York Times* reports that "just hearing about the issue pushed the women toward Mitt Romney \[in 2012\]," according to Obama's director of opinion research. "The lesson the Obama team took from that was simple," the Times says, "Don't talk about immigration."

I have a better suggestion: adopt more popular positions. Why not champion an immigration policy that exerts upward pressure on wages and reduces stress on the environment? That was the Democratic position not long ago, and it should be again.

P.S. Mass immigration is a weapon of mass destruction.
