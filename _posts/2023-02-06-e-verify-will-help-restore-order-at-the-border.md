I ask you to please support U.S. workers by cosponsoring S. 156, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act to mandate E-Verify.

Former Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has accurately assessed and stated on Substack: “Here’s the truth: There is no labor shortage. There is, however, a shortage of jobs paying sufficient wages to attract workers to fill job openings.”

Democrats should be concerned about pull factors — including jobs — that are the root cause of our border crisis. This crisis is undermining U.S. workers forced to compete with migrants willing to accept lower wages.  
It is troubling that there are currently no Democratic bills to make E-Verify mandatory.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. Make E-Verify mandatory.
