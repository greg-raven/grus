2012 is a long way away, but if this last election taught us anything, it is that politicians can no longer hope that their controversial votes will be forgotten come election time. Sen. Reid is setting you up for trouble. You need to vote "NO" on the DREAM Act.

It is completely unethical for anyone even to consider putting forward the DREAM Act amnesty. The estimated two million illegal immigrant children in the United States are only a fraction of the millions of aliens who would benefit from the DREAM Act amnesty, which does not place a cap on the number of people who qualify, provides exceptions to the under-35 age limit, and applies retroactively to anyone who first illegally entered the U.S. before age 16. Furthermore, the recipients of the DREAM Act amnesty will be permitted to petition for their illegal parents and adult relatives to come here once they become citizens.

All this is in addition to the fact that amnesty is not only complete wrong but utterly inappropriate in every way, shape, and form.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. If you don't start thinking and acting pro-America, soon there will be no America left. You might want to start thinking about where you're going to take your ill-gotten millions after you destroy this country.
