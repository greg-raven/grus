The Orlando killer wasn’t on a “no-fly” list.

He wasn’t being currently investigated by the FBI.

He passed numerous background checks, and was a licensed security guard in a courthouse, working for a major security contractor that had contracts with DHS.

Thus, no amount of proposed federal gun control could have prevented the Orlando terrorist from purchasing a gun.

This killer was an ISIS-loving terrorist who openly expressed his desire to engage in mass murder prior to his 911 declaration from the Pulse nightclub.

He was the subject of an FBI investigation two years ago, and the FBI gave him a pass.

And he committed his atrocity in a Gun-Free Zone, where all the victims were disarmed by law.

Not surprisingly, the anti-gun ideologues in Washington are ignoring all this — and are pressing for gun control legislation to pass today or later this week.

I urge you not to vote in favor of any more gun laws.

Instead, we first need to end all immigration until we figure out what immigrants have already come here and what they are doing.

Second, illegal aliens who are not already incarcerated must be removed from the country immediately, regardless of age or pretext for being here.

Third, we need to dismantle “gun-free” zones and sanctuary cities.

Finally, we must establish concealed carry reciprocity.

These last two actions in particular could have made a huge difference in Orlando.
