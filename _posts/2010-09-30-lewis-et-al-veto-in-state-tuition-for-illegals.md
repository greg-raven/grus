California is swimming in red ink. We cannot afford legislation that will unnecessarily increase our fiscal crisis. Please ask Gov. Schwarzenegger to veto SB 1460 and AB 1413 today.

There are currently 10 states which allow illegal aliens to pay in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities. This is a clear violation of the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which was passed by the Congress and signed by President Clinton. Section 8 USC 1623 reads: "... an alien who is not lawfully present in the United States shall not be eligible on the basis of residence within a State for any postsecondary education benefit unless a citizen or national of the United States is eligible for such a benefit ..." Please do not add California to this list.

I supported the prior vetoes of bills that provide in-state tuition and financial aid to illegal aliens. Now, given the state's financial crisis, it is even more important to prevent such legislation from becoming law. I need your help to secure a veto of SB 1460 and AB 1413. Please contact the governor today because they will become law if he does not act by close-of-business.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. If we are to save California, we must control our borders and evict the illegals already in the country. In the meantime, we Must eliminate the factors that draw illegals here in the first place, namely, giveaways such as this one. We should Not be adding to the list of giveaways!
