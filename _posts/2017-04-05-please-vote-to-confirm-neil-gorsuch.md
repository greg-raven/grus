I urge you to reject any filibuster of the Neil Gorsuch nomination — and to vote for him as the Court’s next Supreme Court Justice.

The Denver Post editorial board noted that “Gorsuch is a brilliant legal mind and talented writer whom observers praise for his ability to apply the law fairly and consistently … \[W\]e appreciate his desire to strictly interpret the Constitution,” the paper continued, “based on the intent of our nation’s founders, even when those rulings might contradict his personal beliefs.”

This is exactly what we need — a Justice who will follow the Constitution!

Again, I hope that you will reject any filibuster of Gorsuch’s nomination and vote for him as the Supreme Court’s next Justice.
