In light of the unfounded "threat assessment" on "Rightwing Extremism" issued by DHS Secretary Janet Napolitano, I am calling for Napolitano's immediate removal from office.

While admitting to having no evidence linking "right wing" citizens to actual terror threats, the report nonetheless profiles several conservative groups, including members of the military, pro-life citizens, tax protesters, proponents of Constitutional government, and those who oppose illegal immigration, as terror threats.

Unfortunately, Napolitano and your administration continue to stand behind this flawed report. That is why Napolitano must go and you must apologize to millions of patriotic Americans who have been wrongly profiled by this report.

Sincerely,

P.S.: If you keep Napolitano, have her do a "threat assessment" on the dangers of an illegal alien occupying the office of the President of the United States.
