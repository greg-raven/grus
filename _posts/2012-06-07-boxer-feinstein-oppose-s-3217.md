Senators:

It is ridiculous for anyone to propose legislation that would bring more foreign workers into the United States when millions of American STEM workers can't find jobs. S. 3217, the Startup Act 2.0, would destroy the hopes and dreams of millions of Americans. Please oppose it.

There are 20 million Americans who cannot find a full-time job and many of these are well educated. On top of this, 12.2% of college graduates under 30 cannot find a job of any sort. How does granting even more work permits to skilled foreign workers help these unemployed Americans find jobs? Clearly, it does not.

Why do we need even more foreign tech workers when 1.8 million Americans with engineering degrees are unemployed? Why do we need more of these foreign workers when only 6% of H-1B visa holders are declared "fully competent" by USCIS? 125,000 more foreign workers per year are simply not needed.

What unemployed American STEM workers need is not competition, but jobs. American businesses will not hire jobless Americans if they can hire foreign workers at a lower cost. The Startup Act 2.0 will only keep American workers out of U.S. jobs. Please oppose it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
