Please consider cosponsoring H.R. 2278, the SAFE for America Act. This legislation would end the fraud-ridden visa lottery and needs to be ended to preserve our nation's security.

Fifty-two percent of all lottery visas have been awarded to Europeans, who represent 56 percent of all immigrants since 1820, dispelling the notion that true diversity was the goal of the lottery. The United States does not need to admit a single additional immigrant to ensure increasing ethnic and racial diversity in the U.S. --- it is a demographic certainty. Additionally, the legal immigration flow of around one million per year and another estimated million coming illegally, 50,000 lottery visas have very little impact on diversity, no matter who the beneficiaries are.

Because nationals of virtually every terrorist-sponsoring state are eligible to participate, the visa lottery presents a significant security threat. Department of Homeland Security statistics show that about 54 percent of lottery winners are male, and that about half are single and between the ages of 20 and 34.

Just as worrying as the security impact of the visa lottery are the economic impact. There are 22 million Americans unable to find a job. Don't you find it appalling that the United States continues to allow individuals with no special skills to come to this country? These people will invariably compete with America's unemployed for the few jobs our economy is creating. Is this fair to America's less fortunate?

Please help secure our nation and protect jobs for unemployed Americans by cosponsoring H.R. 2278 to end the visa lottery.
