As this session of Congress moves closer to its close, I am very concerned about the strategy that you and other House members have been floating that would fund President Obama's executive amnesty, even for a short period of time. It is imperative that Congress utilize the power of the purse and defund President Obama's executive amnesty immediately. I urge you to support a bill that would do so.

After your announcement to pass a short-term bill that would fund President Obama's executive amnesty into the new year, Senator Jeff Sessions released a statement reminding everyone of RNC Chairman Reince Priebus' pledge on executive amnesty to not "allow it to happen." Senator Sessions continued, saying your plan "fails to meet that test." Senator Mike Lee then laid out his plan, saying that "The House should quickly pass a short-term CR that includes language prohibiting the use of funds to implement the President's executive action on amnesty."

After investigating the legality of this plan at the behest of Senator Sessions, the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service determined that Congress could block funding for executive amnesty in this manner. Several of your colleagues in the House are also calling for executive amnesty to be defunded immediately. Representative Jim Jordan said, "Why in the world would you want to extend a CR for several monte without waiting for those people (who just won elections) to get here?" Representative John Fleming echoed this sentiment, "I think a lot of us, in discussion, we don't see the purpose of having a long CR."

I urge you to reconsider your plan and pass a bill that defunds President Obama's executive amnesty immediately.
