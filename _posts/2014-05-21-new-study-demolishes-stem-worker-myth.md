I am a science and technology worker and I know that many Americans with degrees in STEM fields are having trouble finding work. The new study released by the Center for Immigration Studies shows that there are far too few jobs for the number of STEM degree-holders in the United States. There is simply no STEM shortage.

The CIS study found that only one-third of Americans with an undergraduate STEM degree actually have a job requiring such a degree. Unfortunately, the rest of these Americans either don't work in the STEM fields or don't have jobs. I hope you will look at the study. There is not a STEM worker shortage, but there is a shortage of STEM jobs.
