H.R. 6283 will immediately begin to rein in out-of-control immigration. You should take a serious look at this bill and consider signing on as a cosponsor.

Supporting H.R. 6283 is the single most important thing that could be done right now to start reining in current overall out-of-control immigration.

It would cut the number of legal immigrants admitted drastically and immediately. In addition, it would eliminate one of the greatest catalysts for illegal immigration by purging the sense of entitlement everybody with relatives in the United States seems to have in thinking that they might as well come to this country illegally since they eventually will qualify for legal status anyway.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
