I was concerned to learn that efforts are being made to pass legislation that would "staple" a green card to four-year and two-year university degrees. There aren't enough jobs for all American and legal immigrant graduates to work in their chosen fields. How would increasing the pool of workers help these new workers?

I urge you to oppose efforts to codify this ludicrous proposal.
