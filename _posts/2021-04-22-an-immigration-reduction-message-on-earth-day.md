Please support the environment by limiting immigration-driven population growth.

Congress needs to heed the intended message of Earth Day and focus on the root causes of environmental degradation --- unsustainable population growth. If America is ever to attain authentic sustainability, then you and Congress must assess the rates, and sources, of population growth.

How much will America's population continue to grow? The answer to this question has been taken out of our hands. Right now, you have decided that the overcrowding, growth, and bulldozing of natural open spaces will continue indefinitely because immigration levels are much too high to allow for a stabilized population.

To relieve the steady degradation of America's environment, please work to stabilize the U.S. population, which can only be done by reducing immigration levels (immigration drives population growth in America). Although multiple presidential commissions have recommended immigration moderation, multiple presidents have failed to do the hard work. I hope that ends with your administration.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
