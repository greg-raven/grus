Oppose the Democratsâ€™ amnesty bill, H.R. 6.

I was disturbed to learn that your Democratic colleagues will soon introduce legislation, H.R. 6, to amnesty Dreamers and TPS recipients. What are they thinking? A no-strings amnesty will only encourage more people to come to the U.S. illegally and encourage more people to overstay their visas. This legislation must be stopped!

I hope you will do all you can to oppose this legislation.
