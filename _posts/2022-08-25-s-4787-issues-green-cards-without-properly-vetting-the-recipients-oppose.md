S. 4787 would issue 100,000 green cards even though the recipients don’t qualify for refugee status or a special immigrant visa program already created by Congress.

The Department of Defense Inspector General found that most of these paroled evacuees were not vetted by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence’s National Counterterrorism Center, posing a risk to national security and public safety.

Please oppose S. 4787.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
