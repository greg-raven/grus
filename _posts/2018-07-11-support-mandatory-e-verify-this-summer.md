It is really important that Congress pass legislation to mandate use of the E-Verify system. E-Verify is easy to use and has the highest satisfaction rates of any government program. Requiring employers to run new hires through E-Verify, as government contractors are already required to do, would prevent the hiring of illegal aliens and make it very hard to remain in the country. If people know that employers are forced to run new hires through E-Verify, fewer people will come to the U.S. illegally in search of work.

Most illegal aliens don't sneak across the border. They initially come with visas and passports, then simply never go home. And, of course, millions of illegal aliens are ALREADY HERE.

Mandating E-Verify is the top legislative priority to fight illegal immigration. E-Verify will simply take away the incentives that entice people to come to the United States illegally in the first place --- namely, JOBS. E-Verify should be the top priority of Congress.

E-Verify is a solution Americans agree on, by massive numbers. Legitimate business-owners want mandatory E-Verify, so the cheaters can't undercut them. Traditional, private-sector labor wants it, to protect American jobs and encourage increases in healthy wages.

Men, women, blacks, whites, Hispanics, legal immigrants, native-born, old, young ... people of every demographic group favor mandatory E-Verify. Republican, independent and Democratic voters support it, so we feel it's the reform most likely to survive a filibuster attempt.

Unfortunately, many in Washington want MORE cheap, unskilled labor ... even while we're still spending hundreds of billions of dollars on anti-poverty programs.

These politicians aren't worried about the workers displaced from their jobs. They like wages so low that taxpayers have to subsidize their illegal alien workers, who mostly qualify for benefits through their kids. And vast numbers of the 50 milion working-age Americans who don't currently have a job will also remain dependent on government aid.

This push for cheap labor is a twisted way to get big government to shell out big, big money ... and have the taxpayers foot the bill! Fortunately, there's a way to fight back.

Mandatory E-Verify will UNDO much harm from decades of open-borders policies.

I have heard that Congress will vote on mandatory legislation before the end of the summer --- I urge you to support it!
