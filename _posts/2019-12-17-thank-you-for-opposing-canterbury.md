- Nominee to lead ATF supports "red flag" gun confiscation orders.

Thank you for your bold defense of the Second Amendment!

Gun Owners of America has highlighted your recent actions which helped to indefinitely postpone Chuck Canterbury's nomination to head the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms, and Explosives.

Canterbury clearly has no idea how the ATF operates, as evidenced by the hearing in July.

But even more concerning to me was his responses to questions for the record which indicated that he would be "happy" to work with Senator Dianne Feinstein on "red flag" gun confiscation!

Not only that, but he also promised Senator Kamala Harris that he would enforce an unconstitutional assault weapons ban.

It would be a travesty to see a Republican Senate confirm a law enforcement nominee who does not respect the constitutional right to keep and bear arms.

I want you to know that gun owners stand with you in this important fight for our rights.

Thank you, again. Keep up the great work, and please resist any and all arm-twisting by the administration to get you to change your vote!
