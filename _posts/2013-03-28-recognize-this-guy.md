It is sweet little Trayvon Martin ... at 17 yrs of age.

At the time of his death, Martin was over six feet tall and weighed 175 pounds. He had had numerous run ins with authorities (both at school and local police).

He had been stopped and almost arrested two days before his death for smacking a bus driver in the face, because the driver refused to let him ride for free. He was released because the driver was told not to press charges by the bus company and to continue on his route.

When "little Trayvon" was suspended at school it was not only because he tried to bring a little marijuana in with him, he was in possession of wedding rings and other jewelry, watches, etc., that he said he "found" along with a large screwdriver while on the way to school that day. The jewelry was turned over to the police by the school.
