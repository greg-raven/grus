America has a huge problem that's getting worse. During the past 20 years, America has lost more than 11.5 million acres of open land (an area about the size of New Jersey and New Hampshire combined) to urban development. This trend is being fueled by population growth.

Urban sprawl is relentlessly consuming America's wide array of natural resources (e.g., wildlife habitat, water supplies, farmland, forests). Unless America changes course, we will bear witness to unprecedented resource scarcity and will be responsible for destroying more wilderness and losses of biodiversity. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, America's population will reach 404 million by 2060 --- another 75 million people --- with roughly 90% due to immigration.

The best way to save our remaining wilderness and wildlife is to reduce our high immigration rates (e.g., by limiting chain migration). Congress must create a humane immigration system that allows America's population to stabilize and save our nation's dwindling open spaces and wildlife. Future generations will be grateful for your leadership.
