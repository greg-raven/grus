At your meet-and-greet event at Johnnie D’s on November 1, 2016, you asked if I believed Liberty Utilities was going to ask for a 14% rate increase. I said I did not. Let me return the favor: Do you believe Liberty will ask for a 14% increase, now that they have apparently asked for an increase of only 4.88%?

Also, at the *Daily Press* candidate forum you stated that the Town had made numerous offers to buy the water company, including a standing offer (that is, one with no expiration date). According to Town documents, though, there has been only one offer, made on June 26, 2015, in the amount $50,300,000. The duration of the offer was 30 days.

If you can cast any light on this discrepancy, I’d appreciate it.
