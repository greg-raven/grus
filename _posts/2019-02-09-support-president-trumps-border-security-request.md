During his primetime address, President Trump reiterated the need for more resources at the border, notably $5.7 billion for new fencing, to combat illegal immigration and mitigate the harm it causes:

> "We have requested more agents, immigration judges, and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support ...
>
> "\[A\]ll Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages ...
>
> "Furthermore, we have asked Congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home."

It is important that Congress passes the necessary legislation to secure our southern border and give the Border Patrol and USCIS the resources they need to combat the current crisis at the border. You can end the shutdown by funding the President's request for high-priority border fencing and additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges, and detention beds.
