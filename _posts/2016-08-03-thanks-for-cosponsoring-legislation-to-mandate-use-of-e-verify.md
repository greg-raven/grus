The hiring of illegal aliens is a major problem in our country and the Legal Workforce Act, H.R. 1147, mandates use of the E-Verify system to prevent this from occurring. I am glad you care as much about this problem as I do. Thank you for cosponsoring this legislation.

This legislation, in addition to requiring employers to run new hires through the Chamber of Commerce-approved E-Verify system, would gently move illegal aliens out of U.S. jobs. Over time, the 7 million illegal aliens in non-agricultural jobs would be replaced by unemployed Americans and legal immigrants. While not solving America’s unemployment or illegal immigration problems, the Legal Workforce Act would certainly lessen their severity.

I’m very glad you care about putting jobless Americans back to work. Please convince your colleagues to support this bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
