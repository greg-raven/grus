I am in opposition to AB 2552 which requires notices to be posted at each public entrance of every gun show in California on the storage, handling, purchase, and theft of firearms.

Recently, there have been numerous moves to cripple the gun show industry, in spite of the fact that they have safely operated in California for over 50 years. There is no “gun show loophole” because all firearm (and related parts) must be processed through a licensed dealer and require a background check, whether the parts are sold in retail stores or gun shows. Every gun show must comply with every statute: background checks, waiting periods and registration requirements. There are zero exceptions; no one can walk into a gun show empty-handed and walk out with a firearm.

There are literally thousands of vendors who sell their products at gun shows throughout the state who are fully aware of the laws that regulate what they can and can’t do. AB 2552 is a punitive measure against people who are operating in a legal manner and will have zero effect on criminal gun crimes.

I stand with Gun Owners of California in opposition to AB 2552.
