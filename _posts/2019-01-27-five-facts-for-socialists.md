- *Five things socialists will never understand*

1. "Free" does not actually mean free.
2. You are not entitled to someone else's hard-earned money ... ever.
3. You cannot tax a nation into prosperity.
4. The rich are not responsible for your financial situation ... you are.
5. Socialism leads to communism ... always.
