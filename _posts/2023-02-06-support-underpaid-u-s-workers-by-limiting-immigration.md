I'm angry that U.S. Labor Secretary Marty Walsh incorrectly claimed that "One of the biggest threats to our economy is not inflation or wage growth, it's lack of workers. And immigration reform is a key to that."

Baloney! Former Labor Secretary Robert Reich stated: "Here's the truth: There is no labor shortage. There is, however, a shortage of jobs paying sufficient wages to attract workers to fill job openings."

To wit: technology companies slashed 150,000 jobs in 2022, and another 45,000 in January alone. Stories of American tech workers forced to train their foreign replacements are not new.

And now, Mississippi growers have replaced Black farmworkers with white guest workers from South Africa.

Please tighten foreign-worker importation to encourage investment in displaced, underpaid, and discriminated-against American workers.

Sincerely,

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
