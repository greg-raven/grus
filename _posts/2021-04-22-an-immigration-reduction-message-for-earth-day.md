Support the environment and limit immigration-driven population growth.

The need to reduce America's population growth rate reflects the same environmental sensibility that came out of the Population and Consumption Task Force of President Clinton's Council on Sustainable Development. The Task Force concluded that long-term environmental sustainability requires stabilizing the U.S. population, and that "reducing immigration levels is a necessary part of population stabilization and the drive toward sustainability."

A far more sustainable immigration level would be around half-million a year recommended by the bipartisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by former Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, in 1995. That would move annual immigration to the approximate level that was the norm as recently as the 1980s.

P.S. We need to go back to making immigration, refugee, and other decisions based on what is good for the American people, not on what may be good for those in other countries.
