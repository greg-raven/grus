Your immigration voting record and that of most of your Democratic colleagues is absolutely dismaying. How can you and your colleagues support foreign worker increases when so many Americans cannot find a job?

It is truly sad that so few of your fellow Democrats in Congress have decided to put American workers ahead of businesses who want to hire even more foreign workers. You would think that Democrats, over Republicans, would realize that the 22 million Americans who cannot find a job need a little extra help during these trying economic times. Unfortunately, most of your colleagues just don't seem to "get it."

Sadly, you don't seem to "get it," either. Your poor NumbersUSA immigration reduction grade proves this. Your grade proves that you have not worked at all to hold down unfair foreign-labor competition to our beleaguered American workers. Indeed, you have decided to put the wants of pro-foreign worker, pro-big business, anti-American worker lobbyists ahead of the needs of your constituents. You should be ashamed of yourself. I am.

However, all is not lost and the situation can be rectified. This is the United States of America and this country and our fellow citizens can do anything we put our minds to. However, Congress must first act to reduce the number of foreign workers so the 22 million Americans without a job have a chance of getting back on their feet and turning this nation and our economy around.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. No amnesty! No special favors for illegal aliens! Secure our borders and evict the illegals who are already in the country! Then we can return to pre-1965 immigration policies.
