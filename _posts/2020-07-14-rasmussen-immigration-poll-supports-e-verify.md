Rasmussen polling shows American voters want mandatory E-Verify.

According to a new Rasmussen poll, American voters believe jobless Americans should take priority over new foreign workers as the economy reopens after the COVID-19. According to the poll:

- 67% say the government should not allow employers to import foreign workers to fill job openings instead of recruiting among unemployed Americans;
- 55% of voters think that the immigration pause should be extended until unemployment rates are back down to the level they were before the pandemic; and
- Just 33% of voters believe the federal government should continue the O.P.T. program that gives tax incentives to hire foreign students who graduate from U.S. schools, while 49% say the government should end the program.

Moreover, 66% of voters think Congress should require U.S. employers to use the federal electronic E-Verify system for all new hires to ensure that open jobs are filled with these unemployed Americans and not with illegal workers.

It's clear that as the economy reopens, Americans believe that jobs should go to jobless Americans instead of illegal aliens and new foreign workers. I hope you will help to make this happen.
