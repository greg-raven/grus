We find it sickening that the Obama Administration is preventing ICE from doing its job. We fear the Administration is simply trying to find ways of issuing de facto amnesties for illegal aliens. We hope you will use your place in the ruling Democratic Party to put a stop to ICE’s emasculation so they are allowed to arrest and deport illegal aliens.  
  
It seems the Obama Administration believes that illegal immigration is a victimless crime. They, of course, are wrong. 2,251,239 Californians are victims. 113,761 Iowans are victims. 150,454 Louisianans are victims. 636,870 Michiganders are victims. 796,714 New Yorkers are victims. 66,678 West Virginians are victims. All of these Americans are victims of illegal immigration because they are unemployed and looking for a job. However, the Obama Administration doesn’t care that 22 million Americans are the victims of illegal immigration because, apparently, illegal immigration is a crime with no victims.

I urge you to right this tremendous wrong by holding hearings and forcing the White House to enforce our nation’s immigration laws. Millions of children are in households struggling from unemployment and depressed wages because millions of illegal aliens have been allowed to hold U.S. jobs. I expect you and your fellow Democrats to remedy this situation directly after the August recess.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Mr. Greg Raven

P.S. Don’t let Obama the illegal immigrant who has usurped our presidency to set our immigration policy. He clearly hates this country, and that includes you!
