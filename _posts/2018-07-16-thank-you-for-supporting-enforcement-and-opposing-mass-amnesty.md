Thank you for supporting immigration enforcement!

Thank you for supporting H.R. 4760, the Securing Americaâ€™s future act! This legislation would mandate the use of the E-Verify system, end chain migration and the visa lottery, and reduce immigration numbers --- all things that need to happen. It is disappointing that so many of your Republican colleagues voted against sensible immigration policy changes.

Thank you again and please continue to support immigration enforcement and sensible immigration changes and be sure to oppose terrible immigration bills such as the Ryan "compromise."
