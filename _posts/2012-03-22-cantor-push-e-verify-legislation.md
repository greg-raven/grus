Thank you for going on Greta Van Susteren and telling America that you care so deeply about what bills Americans want to "cosponsor." I wanted to let you know that I'm "cosponsoring" H.R. 2885, the Legal Workforce Act.

Mandating the use of E-Verify would unlock opportunities for the most disadvantaged members of our society, primarily less-educated younger adults. This includes millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans with no more than a high school degree, who suffer long-term unemployment rates of over 30 percent. They are the ones most likely to be seeking the construction, service, transportation, and manufacturing jobs that illegal aliens hold.

H.R. 2885 would put millions of Americans back to work, especially our nation's most vulnerable. Apparently, though, these Americans don't matter to you or whomever added bills to your website for Americans to "cosponsor."

Please make sure that H.R. 2885 is added to your website forthwith so that I, and thousands of other Americans, can register our support.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. You swore an oath to protect this country. The only ones attacking our country currently are invaders from south of our southern border. This should provide you with an excellent opportunity to do the job you promised to do.
