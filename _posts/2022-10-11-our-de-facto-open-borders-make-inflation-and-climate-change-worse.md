The Real Clear Policy article, "Our De Facto Open Border Makes Inflation &amp; Climate Change Worse" (October 4, 2022) tells the sad truth:

"If you were seeking to inflict the maximum pain on the American people during a time of high inflation and scarcity of goods and services, you would implement de facto open borders. And if you wanted to cancel out any of the positive effects of the recently passed so-called Inflation Reduction Act on climate change, you'd also want to keep that border wide open."

Reasonable solutions are available, from restoring the Migration Protections Protocols, to raising the "credible fear" standard. I am very sorry to witness this Congress's and this administration's utter failure to act, or even acknowledge the depth of this crisis, the worst in U.S. history.

P.S. Secure our borders and evict all those illegals here!
