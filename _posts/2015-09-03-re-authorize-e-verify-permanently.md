E-Verify expires at the end of September and it's time for Congress to permanently authorize the program and make its use mandatory for all employers. H.R. 1147, the Legal Workforce Act, would permanently authorize the program and mandate its use. I hope you will push for its passage.

The Legal Workforce Act would, within three years, require all employers to run new hires through the E-Verify system. Isn't this great news? Instead of unscrupulous employers being able to drive down wages and take advantage of illegal aliens, they will now be obliged to hire unemployed Americans and legal immigrants.

E-Verify is safe, accurate, and easy to use, and it's use is even supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This bill is pro-American worker and pro-American business. It will help millions of Americans find work and help to combat ID theft. Please support it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
