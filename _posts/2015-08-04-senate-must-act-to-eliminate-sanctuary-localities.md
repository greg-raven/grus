It is disappointing that the Senate has not yet acted to prevent sanctuary cities from receiving federal law enforcement funding. Now that the House has passed such legislation, I hope the Senate will follow suit by passing S. 1640, the Davis-Oliver Act. Please do all you can to make this happen.

Sanctuary localities make our entire country less safe by refusing to hand over illegal aliens to I.C.E. for removal proceedings, even if the illegal aliens have a criminal record. The arrogance of these localities is beyond belief and has resulted in the deaths of innocent Americans. By attempting to protect illegal aliens from deportation, they are knowingly and wantonly harboring dangerous illegal aliens. The ramifications of which were sadly played out in San Francisco when an innocent woman was shot by an illegal alien who had been deported five times. This death was preventable and it must serve as a lesson for our communities and our nation.

Sen. Dianne Feinstein realizes just how wrong her home city of San Francisco has been on this issue when she said:

> "It is clear to me that we have to improve cooperation between federal, state, and local law enforcement. \[...\] When immigration authorities ask that a state or local law enforcement agency notify them of an impending release of an alien with a serious felony record, that request should be honored. I strongly believe that local authorities should have notified the immigration authorities in the case of the accused murderer of Kate Steinle."

The Davis-Oliver Act, S. 1640, would rectify the situation by blocking SCAAP and federal law enforcement grants going to sanctuary localities and preventing DHS from releasing criminal illegal aliens. I hope you will support and pass this legislation and help to complete the House's work.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
