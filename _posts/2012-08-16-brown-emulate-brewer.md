Governor Jerry Brown,

Arizona Governor Jan Brewer has taken another courageous step in defending our country and way of life by issuing [an executive order denying driver’s licenses](https://www.newsmax.com/Newsfront/AZ-BLCPOLSTL-BNALL-BNCOPY/2012/08/15/id/448729) to illegal aliens, despite Traitor-in-chief Barack Hussein Obama’s illegal unilateral amnesty.  
  
I urge you to take similar measures immediately.

If you’re really serious about getting the economy in California back on track, you start enforcing our existing laws and crack down on illegal immigration.
