Why are you continuing to push for a comprehensive amnesty that would continue to put even more Americans out of work?

20 million Americans can't get a full-time job. Unfortunately, you seem to be either unaware of this fact. Or worse, you simply don't care. You don't seem to care that millions of families are having trouble putting a roof over their family's head and putting food on the table. You don't seem to care that millions of Americans are barely getting by on government benefits or living from paycheck to paycheck.

Instead of proposing immigration legislation that would make a positive impact on the lives of these Americans, your plan will make matters even worse --- it will want to flood the marketplace with cheap labor. It's bad enough that our government allows 1 million foreign workers to come to the U.S. each year to take jobs away from deserving American workers, now you are talking about a plan that could permanently disemploy at least 11 million Americans.

Americans need a president who will stand up for them, not one who stands up for illegal aliens. Please start being that president.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Even as an illegal alien yourself, you should be at least a little concerned about the $2.6 trillion in additional costs created by your position.
