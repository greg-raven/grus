As a voter in your district, I’m writing today to ask that you please oppose any new gun control legislation. Rather than blaming law-abiding gun owners for the acts of criminals and widespread failings of government agencies at the federal and state level, please support and focus on legislation that will protect our schools and fix our broken mental health system.

Punishing law-abiding gun owners by passing gun control won’t stop crime but it will leave many of us defenseless. Please support the Second Amendment and oppose any gun control proposals such as waiting periods, gun and magazine bans or restrictions on the ability of law-abiding adults to purchase firearms or ammunition.

I look forward to hearing from you and will consider your response and any votes the next time I head to the polls.
