I urge you to disapprove the waivers granted by EPA to California that are currently being considered under the Congressional Review Act. If not disapproved, these waivers will limit consumer vehicle choice, increase costs at the taxpayer and consumer levels, and impose stringent policies that are impractical. 

As your constituent, residing in your district, I encourage you to prioritize our energy security and consider the impact the California waivers would have across the nation in setting unreasonable policies that impact energy costs, affect supply chains, and have a negative recourse that will be felt across the country. The government should not mandate one energy resource over the other but allow for all types of energy to provide affordable and reliable energy sources to power our everyday lives. 

Please stand up and disapprove the California waivers as they will negatively impact not only your constituents but America's energy security and progress.
