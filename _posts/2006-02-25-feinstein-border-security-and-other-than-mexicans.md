I hope you will use your influence to get a fence built along our border.

You have pointed out that “Other Than Mexicans” caught crossing the border has jumped from 49,545 in 2003 to 155,000 in the last year. 9/11 was four and a half years ago. This is unacceptable.

I do hope that you will make border security a top priority this year.

Sincerely,
