What becomes of America, now that Obama has usurped the presidency? Clearly, if Obama has his way, we will be attempting to retry the failed experiment of the former Soviet Union, with Obama playing the role of Premier Comrade. If his goals are evidenced by his utterances, he plans to destroy the U.S. by making our well-being and security secondary to his anti-coal ideology, he plans to institutionalize corruption in government by making millions of citizens and non-citizens dependent on and beholding to the government for money, and he plans to fundamentally destroy the remains of our once-fair republic by throwing off the Constitutional limits in favor of a mandate for government to provide food, housing, jobs, iPods, diplomas, bling, and who-knows-what-else to everyone in the deserving class (as if our current "limited" government wasn't already big enough). If he's successful, there will be no more America by the end of his term.

The only reasons I see for hope for America are:

1. Politicians rarely keep their campaign promises, and as Obama's promise is to destroy America, we may yet survive; and

2. The economy is bad and is probably going to become worse over the next couple of years (at a minimum). This will mean that Obama simply won't be able to afford to pay off all those who believe themselves to be entitled to receiving that which they did not earn.

Actually, there is one other extremely remote possibility: If someone can establish in court before the inauguration\* that Obama is not Constitutionally qualified to be President, it would marginally increase our chances of survival. John McCain and/or the Republican Party should be the ones doing this, but they aren't, which as far as I'm concerned spells the end of the Republican Party.

\* This has to happen before the inauguration because there seems to be no mechanism to remove a sitting President who does not meet the qualifications for becoming President, and certainly a Democrat-controlled legislative branch is not going to impeach Obama on such a trivial technicality.
