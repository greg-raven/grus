I'm deeply concerned about the Biden Administration's continued abuse of executive "parole" that allows foreign nationals to stay and work in the United States without a visa, including the more than 100,000 Afghan evacuees who were given parole and don't qualify for refugee status or the special immigrant visa program created by Congress.

A group of Senators have introduced S. 4787 to give these Afghan parolees green cards. Please oppose this legislation and any effort to add it to the must-pass spending bills that will come for a vote this fall. Given the government's well-established inability to properly vet, the chances that the AAA, if it became law, would be carried out as written are slim.
