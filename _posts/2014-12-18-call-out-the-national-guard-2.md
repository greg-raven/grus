The Border Patrol is being overrun by illegal aliens trying to cross the border. Please send them help by calling up the National Guard to help secure the border.

Thousands of illegal aliens are trying to cross our borders each day. Unfortunately, many of them are making it across and overwhelming the Border Patrol. Instead of concentrating on securing the border, the Border Patrol is being tasked with processing and guarding thousands upon thousands of illegal aliens who should have been stopped and turned back at the border.

The National Guard can and should play a vital role in keeping our nation safe. They need to be sent to the border to protect our nation and help to halt illegal immigration. With thousands attempting to cross each week, the National Guard can give the Border Patrol important backup and help to stem the flow of illegal aliens. Please call up the National Guard. Their help is needed.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven

P.S. As a great former governor of California once said, "A country without a border is not a country."
