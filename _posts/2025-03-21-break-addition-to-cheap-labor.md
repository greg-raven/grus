Say "NO" to cheap labor. Limit H-1B program and end OPT.

Mass immigration has fed America's addiction to cheap labor.

Americans have had enough of corporations using programs like H-1B and OPT to hire cheaper workers with mostly basic skills to displace domestic workers in middle-class jobs.

Please let me know what you will do to cut immigration, including guest worker programs like  H-1B and OPT.
