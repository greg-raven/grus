According to the news today, an earthquake in the Solomon Islands has lifted a prime coral reef 10 feet free of the sea, effectively destroying the reef. That is, in a couple of minutes, "nature" destroyed something in a way that man could not have, short of using nuclear devices.  
  
I'm not saying that mankind has so little effect on the environment that we should be allowed to foul our living space any way we choose, but occurrences such as this should remind us that we are all but powerless compared to the natural forces that surround us. To subscribe to the hubris that mankind is somehow in charge of everything that happens on this planet is blind, ignorant folly.
