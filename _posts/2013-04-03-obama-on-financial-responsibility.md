> "The President has proclaimed the month of April National Financial Capability Month. What is National Financial Capability Month? Itâ€™s the federal government helping individuals and families make more accurate budgets."

> <cite>(source)</cite>

Then this:

> "The Obama administration is engaged in a broad push to make more home loans available to people with weaker credit, an effort that officials say will help power the economic recovery but that skeptics say could open the door to the risky lending that caused the housing crash in the first place."
