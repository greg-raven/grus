More from the biggest idiot ever to hold the office of the president.

> “The President has proclaimed the month of April National Financial Capability Month. What is National Financial Capability Month? It’s the federal government helping individuals and families make more accurate budgets.”

> <cite>(source)</cite>

Then this:
