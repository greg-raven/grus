H.R. 4437 provides the immigration solution most Americans want according to a new Zogby poll.

When given a neutral choice (avoiding "amnesty" and "illegal alien") Americans, 2 to 1, favor the House approach of H.R. 4437 over Senate proposals to legalize illegal aliens and double annual immigration from 1 to 2 million. 

The poll found that Americans want less, not more, immigration. Sixty-seven percent of respondents said immigration should be reduced so we can assimilate those already here. 

As well, support for the approach of H.R. 4437 cut across party lines with 81 percent of Republicans, 72 percent of independents, and 57 percent of Democrats supporting it. 

This suggests that your continued support of H.R. 4437 is the best way to win favor with voters this fall.

P.S. We need to take further steps to secure our borders, culture, and way of life, but H.R. 4437 seems to be a good interim action.
