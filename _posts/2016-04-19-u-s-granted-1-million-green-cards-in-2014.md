Recently released statistics from DHS show that the U.S. issued more than 1 million green cards in 2014. This is far too high a number and Congress needs to take action to cut immigration numbers.  
  
With more than 1 million green cards issued each year and 1 million new foreign workers coming to the U.S. each year, it is impossible for the country to create enough jobs for millions of new immigrants and the tens of millions of Americans who desperately need one. 64% of those given green cards in 2014 did not receive legal permanent residency based on merit, but on having a U.S. citizen family member.

More than 14 million Americans cannot find a full-time job and tens of millions more have simply given up looking for work. It is unsustainable to give out 1 million green cards each year when so many Americans are struggling to find a job.

I urge you to do all you can to reduce immigration numbers, particularly among those who are granted legal permanent residency based on non-nuclear family ties.
