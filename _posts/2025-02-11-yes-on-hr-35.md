The House will soon hold a floor vote on H.R. 35, the Agent Raul Gonzalez Officer Safety Act. This legislation, while limited in scope, will aid border security by making it a crime to evade the Border Patrol and the state and local agents who assist them. Moreover, the legislation would make evading the Border Patrol a deportable offense, making it speedier and easier to deport illegal border crossers.

The stricter penalties for endangering law enforcement will help protect the men and women working to keep our country safe.

Please vote YES on H.R. 35.
