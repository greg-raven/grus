I am contacting you today to ask that you vote YES on two upcoming bills.

The first bill was introduced earlier this week by Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania. The Stop Dangerous Sanctuary Cities Act, S.3100, would define a “sanctuary city” as any state-level jurisdiction that fails to communicate with federal immigration officers or comply with a detainer request. The bill would also block certain federal grants to sanctuary jurisdictions and protect local police from liability if they act on behalf of DHS.

The second bill was introduced shortly after last year’s tragic shooting of San Francisco woman Kate Steinle by a five-times deported illegal alien who had been set free by the San Francisco police department. “Kate’s Law,” S.2193, was introduced by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and would impose mandatory sentencing for certain criminal aliens or repeat illegal border crossers.

Tomorrow marks the one-year anniversary of Kate Steinle’s death, but over the years thousands of Americans have fallen victim to illegal aliens who have been released by local authorities against the wishes of federal immigration agents.

Your support for each of these bills is critical. It’s time to end sanctuary cities once and for all!
