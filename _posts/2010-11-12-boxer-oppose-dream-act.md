It is absolutely disgusting that Majority Leader Reid wants to force the DREAM Act amnesty through the lame duck session! I expect you to do the right thing for American workers and oppose this horrible mass amnesty.

It is completely unethical for Leader Reid to even consider pushing through the DREAM Act amnesty. It's estimated there are currently some two million illegal immigrant children in the United States. They are only a fraction of the millions of aliens who would qualify for the DREAM Act amnesty, because the DREAM Act does not place a cap on the number of people who qualify, provides exceptions to the under-35 age limit, and applies retroactively to anyone who first illegally entered the U.S. before age 16. Furthermore, the recipients of the DREAM Act amnesty will be permitted to petition for their illegal parents and adult relatives to come here once they become citizens. Surely this loophole should be closed before legislation such as the DREAM Act is even considered?

The marketing campaign for the 2007 DREAM Act made it seem that the amnesty was intended for high school graduates who were on their way to college or the armed forces. But the bill, as written, ensured that illegal immigrants did not have to attend high school or go to college to qualify for the amnesty: they needed only to take an ability-to-benefit test and complete a one-year vocational program to get on the path to citizenship (and there was no requirement that they actually complete their college education).

There are 22 millions who cannot find a job and the Congress should not consider passing any amnesty when so many Americans are out of work (and so many illegal aliens have jobs). Even if you support the DREAM amnesty in principle, I hope you realize that a jobs depression is the wrong time and a lame duck session is the wrong place to pass such legislation.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. No amnesty! No special favors for illegal aliens! Secure our borders and evict the illegals who are already in the country!
