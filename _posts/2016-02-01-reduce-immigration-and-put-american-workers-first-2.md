A new NumbersUSA television ad features civil rights icon Barbara Jordan who chaired the last bi-partisan commission on immigration. The Jordan Commission recommended cutting legal immigration to 550,000 annually. I support the recommendations of the Jordan Commission and urge you to do so as well.

The Commission found that foreign workers patterns that are harmful to vulnerable Americans are also harmful to the economy as a whole. The Commission recommended ending the endless chains of family migration by eliminating several of the family-based green card categories and ending the Visa Lottery. It also recommended requiring all business to use an employment verification system, such as E-Verify, and implementing an entry-exit system to track foreign visitors.

These are commonsense solutions that have broad support among the American people.

With more than 15 million Americans looking for full-time work, does it really make sense to continue to import more than 1 million new foreign workers each year? I don't think it does, and I urge you enact the Commission's recommendations.
