Please work with President Trump to fulfill his goal of improving the lives of all Americans. I am confident that Congress can work in a non-partisan manner to make this happen.

President Trump recognizes that American workers and families are being harmed by a litany of forces, including a chaotic and archaic immigration policy. The president said: “Every decision on trade, on taxes, on immigration, on foreign affairs will be made to benefit American workers and American families. We must protect our borders from the ravages of other countries making our products, stealing our companies and destroying our jobs.”

I hope you can work with the president to change our nation’s policies and laws so that the American people can thrive and American workers can prosper.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
