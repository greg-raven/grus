I was very pleased to see that H.R. 38 --- the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act --- advanced out of the House Judiciary Committee for a full floor vote in the House. 

As your constituent, I urge you to VOTE YES on H.R. 38 and I also urge you to pressure Speaker Johnson to hold the full floor vote ASAP. 

No one should be turned into a felon simply for traveling with a lawfully-owned firearm across state lines. 

With all 50 states now issuing concealed carry permits, 49 states allowing nonresident carry, and 29 states with permitless or constitutional carry, it is simply common sense for Congress to ensure that each state's concealed carry license is valid in every other state. 

Just as driver's licenses and marriage licenses are recognized nationwide, so too should a license to carry a firearm --- especially since the Constitution explicitly protects gun rights, and doesn't say a peep about driving a car! 

In fact, the Constitution states that my right to keep and bear arms "shall not be infringed." 

You promised voters like me on the campaign trail to uphold and defend the Constitution. Do not let us down. Vote for the Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act and ask Speaker Johnson to hold the vote immediately. 

Gun Owners of America will be sure to tell me how you vote.
