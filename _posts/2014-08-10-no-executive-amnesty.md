The Washington Post is reporting that your Administration is preparing to move forward with an executive action that would protect 5-6 million illegal aliens from deportation and grant them work permits. But it was your similar action for childhood arrivals that caused the ongoing border crisis, and an expanded action would make the situation worse. I urge you stop protecting illegal aliens and start protecting American workers.

Since 2011, your actions on immigration have repeatedly sent signals around the world that illegal immigration will be tolerated (even rewarded) in the United States. These policies have contributed to the surge in illegal immigration at the border today.

Last month, a House vote, by contrast, sent a powerful message that an illegal journey to this country may not pay off. Not only could it help save lives of foreign citizens who attempt the dangerous trek to our Southern border, but by blocking future work permits for millions of illegal workers, it would protect the 18 million U.S. citizens who want a full-time job but can't find one.

The House vote showed that the Representatives of the American people may be ready to be the champions of the American workers who stand to lose the most if you follow through with your promise. I urge you to side with American workers and not illegal aliens!

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Stop the flow of illegal aliens immediately. America does NOT need any more people like you.
