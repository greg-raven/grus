I am a constituent who believes it is unconstitutional and wrong to try to give illegal immigrants in California a guest worker amnesty. Please vote NO on A.B. 1544.

States cannot set up their own guest worker programs. That's federal jurisdiction and no federal waivers exist to implement AB1544. Besides, federal guest worker programs already exist. It makes no sense to duplicate efforts, especially given the state's budget problems.

AB1544 is on the Assembly's docket because big Agriculture wants to maintain high profits by employing cheap, illegal foreign workers. You must understand, however, that citizens will not stand for this scam.

Please vote no on AB1544. And if a corporate farmers asks why you're voting no, say they have better options, like using the federal H-2A program or paying a living wage.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
