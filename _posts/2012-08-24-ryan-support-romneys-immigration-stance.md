Representative Paul Ryan,

As a swing voter, I am counting on you to support immigration policies that will protect American workers and taxpayers from the effects of uncontrolled immigration.  
  
Mass immigration is inconsistent with a philosophy of shrinking the size of both government and our national debt.

The Heritage Foundation has calculated that an average low-skilled immigrant household costs federal, local, and state governments $19,588 per year more than it pays in all taxes. Furthermore, they have found that for every $1 that illegal aliens contribute to Social Security, they withdraw $10 in government services.

Specifically, Heritage notes that “It is true that low-skill immigrant households pay, on average, around $2,900 per year in Social Security (FICA) taxes; however, the average Social Security and Medicare benefits they receive actually exceed the FICA taxes paid. Of course, low-skill immigrant households receive many other government benefits as well, receiving ten dollars in total government benefits for each dollar they pay in Social Security taxes.”

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven

P.S. The next administration needs to represent Americans and American interests, not foreigners and foreign interests.
