Stop enticing illegal immigrants to California while our water supply shrinks.

It is unacceptable that Californians are on the precipice of being forced to take five minutes showers and avoid baths while our Governor continues to push for more immigration to our state. You must stop this madness and work towards adopting moderate immigration policies that would allow for our population to stabilize. Please address this issue and reduce immigration before the water shortage becomes even direr.

Sincerely,

Mr. Greg Raven, Apple Valley, CA

P.S. This principle extends to our electrical power situation, too. If our grid is so lousy that we have to stop using electricity between 4 and 9 p.m., then we shouldnâ€™t be adding more persons to our population. Secure our border, stop immigration, and evict any illegals and/or asylum-seekers who are already here.
