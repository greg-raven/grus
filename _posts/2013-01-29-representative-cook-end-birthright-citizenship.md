Representative Paul Cook

The United States should not reward individuals who have broken our nation's laws. With this in mind, I hope you'll support H.R. 140 offered by Rep. Steve King so that the children of illegal aliens are not rewarded with birthright citizenship.  
  
8 U.S.C. 1401 currently says that "a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth." Clearly, the Constitution does not need to be changed in order to prevent the children of illegal aliens from receiving birthright citizenship; a simple piece of legislation will do.

The United States is almost the only industrialized nation to still practice jus soli --- birthright citizenship. I expect you to help America get with the times by supporting legislation that would change our nation's laws and prevent the children of illegal aliens from receiving birthright citizenship. When this is done, illegal aliens will have one less anchor keeping them in this country, thereby opening of millions of jobs for America's unemployed.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
