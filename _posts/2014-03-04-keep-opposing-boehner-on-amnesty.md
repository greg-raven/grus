I cannot believe that Speaker Boehner told a group of agricultural leaders that America just can't handle mandatory E-Verify yet and "immigration reform" should come first. This counts as an amnesty by every definition of the word and I hope you will oppose it.  
  
The Merriam-Webster Dictionary defines an amnesty as "the act of an authority (such as the government) by which pardon is granted to a large number of individuals."

Speaker Boehner's plan would nullify the prescribed penalties for those who come to this country illegally or overstay their visas --- namely being arrested and deported. At current estimate, the number of illegal aliens living in the United States number anywhere from 11 to 18 million, which by anyone's definition constitutes a "large number of individuals." On top of this, his plan would make it hard for authorities to find and deport illegal aliens. I hope you will also note that whether individuals pay a fine or back taxes is irrelevant to the definition of amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. I know you have opposed Boehner's traitorous position on immigration in the past. Keep up the good work.
