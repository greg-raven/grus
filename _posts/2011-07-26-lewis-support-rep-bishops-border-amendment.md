Please support Rep. Bishop’s Border amendment to the Interior Department spending bill. This amendment protects national forests and lands along the border from being overrun by illegal aliens.  
  
Rep. Bishop’s Border Amendment to the Interior Department spending bill would ensure immigration enforcement along the entire border. Please support this bill.
