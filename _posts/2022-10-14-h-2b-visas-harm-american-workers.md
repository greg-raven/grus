I was disappointed to learn that DHS Secretary Mayorkas has issued an additional 65,000 H-2B visas. As H-2B visas typically cover seasonal and temporary low-skill jobs, these visas disproportionately harm young and less-educated Americans. Increasing H-2B visa numbers would prevent thousands more young Americans from entering the workplace.

Investigative reports have shown that businesses are more than willing to fire American workers when H-2B workers become available. It's clear that the H-2B program, which is fraught with abuse, harms young and less-educated Americans.

Moreover, the most recent labor participation rate is only 62.3%, which is below pre-Covid levels and well below 2009 levels. There is simply no need to import additional low-skilled workers.

Please oppose reauthorizing additional H-2B visas as part of the upcoming omnibus spending bill!
