Open the doors to the Senate Judiciary Committee's secret meeting on amnesties for illegal aliens and let the American citizens know which Senators are responsible for making the right or wrong decisions.

Please take any action necessary to prevent your colleagues in the Senate Judiciary Committee from producing an immigration bill that would reward illegal aliens for breaking our nation's laws.

Concerned citizens across our state trust that you, our voice in Congress, will prevent the Judiciary Committee from granting any and all amnesties that would grant citizenship to 12 million illegal aliens who've shown little, if any, respect for the laws that govern our nation and its people.

I encourage you to support the enforcement-only bill that Senate Majority Leader Bill Frist (R-TN) has promised --- as long as it does not include any increase in green cards.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. No amnesties! No guest-worker programs! Seal the border and evict the illegals already here. We must do this Now!
