I am very disappointed to hear that you voted YEA on yesterday's S. Amdt. 3192 to S 2454. Thank goodness it failed anyway. Today, I am writing in regards to the Hagel/Martinez bill, which as I understand it is 95% of the Judiciary Committee's horrid amnesty proposal, which was voted down Thursday.

**I am urging you to oppose the Hagel amnesty and to vote NO on cloture.**

The Hagel/Martinez bill offers an amnesty path to citizenship for nearly every illegal alien in this country, rewarding criminal behavior. This must be opposed at all costs. A vote for cloture is a vote for your constituents, and for America.
