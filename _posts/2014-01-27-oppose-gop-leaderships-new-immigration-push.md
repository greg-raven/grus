News reports, quoting unnamed GOP leadership aides, are suggesting that House Republicans are planning to push for work permits for illegal aliens in the coming weeks and months. These reports have obviously troubled me greatly and I hope they aren’t true.  
  
Politico is reporting:

“House Republican leaders are within weeks of releasing their principles for immigration reform — a blueprint that will detail positions on everything from border security to legal status….

“The draft principles will also include a promise that immigration reform will be done on a step-by-step basis and will foreclose the possibility of entering into conference negotiations using the Senate’s comprehensive package — pledges that could soothe some Republicans.”

How can Politico be correct when Speaker Boehner has maintained that an immigration bill would not be introduced unless it has the support of the majority of House Republicans? Please come out and make it clear that Politico has it wrong and House Republicans aren’t contemplating moving in this direction.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. You absolutely must oppose this push. Immigration is killing our country, and destroying our way of life.
