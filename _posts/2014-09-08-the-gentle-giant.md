I realize it’s not very timely, but I just received this myself. This is a photo of Michael Brown that he posted on his Facebook page.

According to the narrative, Michael Brown was the "child" that was shot and killed by a racist white police officer in Ferguson, MO, after the officer saw Brown just walking down the street minding his own business.

CNN reported that he was an "Innocent unarmed child headed off to college." Other reports say he was a "gentle giant."

Later, surveillance video showed that Brown had just robbed a convenience store.

Please notice the Glock handgun pointed at the camera and a mouthful of cash! Other removed photos showed him in the colors of the Bloods and giving the hand signs of the Bloods gang.

The photos were removed by Facebook at the insistence of his family’s attorneys.
