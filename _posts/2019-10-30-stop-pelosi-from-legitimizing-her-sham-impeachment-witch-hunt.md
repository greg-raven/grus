I've learned that Nancy Pelosi and more radical elements of the Democratic Party in Congress have officially launched impeachment proceedings against President Trump.

As a FreedomWorks activist, I urge you to ignore the unhinged propaganda from the Left, listen to the American people, and OPPOSE this impeachment crusade.

From day one, radicals like Rashida Tlaib and Maxine Waters have been determined to force President Trump from office. They've been totally unconcerned as to how it was done, whether the evidence proved that was the best course of action, or whether it was what the American people wanted.

That's obvious from how Jerrod Nadler, Adam Schiff, and Nancy Pelosi have managed their impeachment circus. They've totally abandoned precedent, blatantly broken House rules, and denied the President any opportunity to defend himself.

Even Richard Nixon and Bill Clinton had the chance to cross-examine witnesses and offer evidence, and in both those cases, the full House had access to all the facts.

But President Trump has no fair chance to defend himself, and Pelosi's impeachment inquiry is taking place entirely behind closed doors WITHOUT the approval of the full House.

They don't care about the facts. They don't care about fairness. They don't care about the truth. They want President Trump GONE. Full stop.

This is totally unfair and just the latest in a series of failed attempts to undo the 2016 election and disregard the will of the American people.

I urge you to see this sham for the political circus that it is and OPPOSE Nancy Pelosi's Impeachment Crusade.
