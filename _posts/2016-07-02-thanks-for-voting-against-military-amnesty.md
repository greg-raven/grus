Your vote in favor of the Gosar amendment to the NDAA shows that you support our troops and oppose giving illegal aliens amnesty and legal status. Thank you.

While it is disappointing that the Gosar amendment did not pass, I am glad you voted in favor of it. No one should be allowed to join the military simply to receive amnesty or legal status. Thank you for supporting our nation's security and America's brave men and women in uniform.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
