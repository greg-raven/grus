It infuriates me that border crossings rose in July, proving that the end of the border crisis is nowhere in sight. I hope that the Senate will use the fiscal year appropriations process to include provisions in the House-passed H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, in the Continuing Resolution.

The CBS News article "Illegal border crossings rose by 33% in July, fueled by increase along Arizona desert" explains:

"\[T\]he increase in illegal crossings threatens the Biden administration's migration management strategy, which it credited for the two-year low in apprehensions in June. The strategy relies on programs that allow tens of thousands migrants to enter the U.S. with the government's permission each month, and heighten asylum standards for those who fail to use these procedures and instead cross into the country illegally."

H.R. 2 includes parole and asylum abuse reforms, child labor protections and E-Verify that would help communities overwhelmed with large numbers of migrants arriving daily.
