U.S. wages go down while inflation goes up. Send H.R. 2 to Biden.

The Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund Kristalina Georgieva recently said that "abundant labor coming across the border" is keeping U.S. wages down.

I am outraged that our border crisis is driving down wages while Americans are enduring high inflation.

Please contact me to discuss supporting U.S. workers and their families by ending asylum and parole abuse and mandating E-Verify through H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act.
