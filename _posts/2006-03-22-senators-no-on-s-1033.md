I’m writing to make sure you fully understand the numeric impact of the McCain-Kennedy immigration proposal, S. 1033. It would add at least 25 million foreign workers and their dependents to our already overcrowded communities over the next ten years.

The media are reporting that S. 1033 will likely be included in the immigration bill that is reported out of the Senate Judiciary Committee to be considered by the full Senate next week.

I find it outrageous that the Judiciary Committee would decide to further flood our American occupations and communities with foreign workers and their dependents — as many as 25 million over the next ten years.

Please stand up for American workers and oppose this potential disaster for hardworking Americans and legal immigrants.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. I want NO new immigrants, and NO guest worker plan. Secure our border NOW and evict the criminals who are already here!
