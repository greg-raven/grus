Democratic Senator Amy Klobuchar stated: "We must do all we can to prevent human smuggling and trafficking across both our country's borders."

E-Verify could go further in preventing human smuggling and trafficking as the primary magnet for illegal immigration is the potential to work in the United States.

While there is bipartisan E-Verify legislation introduced in the House, there are still no Democratic Senators supporting S. 156, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act.

Please help end human smuggling and trafficking across our borders and cosponsor E-Verify bill S. 156.

Sincerely,

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
