I am deeply disturbed that Speaker Boehner has hired a former McCain immigration advisor and chief of staff to be his immigration legislative advisor. Her hiring is a clear sign that he intends to push for amnesty and comprehensive immigration reform in 2014. She worked on amnesty for Sen. McCain and previously worked for the pro-amnesty Bipartisan Policy Center. Please keep this in mind when dealing with the speaker on immigration issues.  
  
The speaker’s new aide was supportive of the bipartisan effort made in the Senate and has continued to call for comprehensive immigration reform since the Schumer-Rubio amnesty bill passed. She has an active Twitter account and has often used it as a way to spread pro-amnesty articles and op-eds. I fear this is one of the reasons Speaker Boehner hired her.

It’s scary that Speaker Boehner and the leadership are being informed on immigration matters by someone who is unashamedly pro-amnesty. I hope you won’t forget this when the speaker wishes to discuss amnesty legislation.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
