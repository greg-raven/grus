I am asking you to OPPOSE AND FILIBUSTER Resident Obama's nomination of anti-life, anti-liberty, and anti-Christian Judge David Hamilton to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.  
  
Whereas, Judge Hamilton issued anti-liberty, anti-Christian injunctions which prohibited any prayers offered "in Jesus name" by civilian guest pastors visiting the Indiana legislature (which bad decision was later overturned by the 7th Circuit), and

Whereas, Judge Hamilton issued anti-life rulings striking down a reasonable law requiring abortionists simply inform women about alternatives to abortion in the presence of a physician or nurse (which bad decision was also overturned by the 7th Circuit), and  
  
Whereas, the American Bar Association rated Judge Hamilton as 'not qualified' during his original appointment to the federal bench,

Therefore, Judge David Hamilton is too extremist and unfit to serve in a place of such authority as the 7th Circuit Court, the same court which frequently overturned his bad anti-life, anti-liberty, and anti-Christian rulings.

We therefore request you OPPOSE AND FILIBUSTER the nomination of the anti-life, anti-liberty, and anti-Christian Judge David Hamilton to the 7th Circuit Court of Appeals.

I hope you will oppose Judge Hamilton.

Sincerely,

[Greg Raven](https://www.gregraven.org/)
