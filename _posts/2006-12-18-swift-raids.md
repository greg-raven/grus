I applaud your administration's raids on the Swift & Co. meat packing plants.

While politicians continue to promote unnecessary and unwanted guestworker-amnesty schemes, Americans across the country are witnessing the power of Attrition Through Enforcement. Local ordinances and arrests in the workplace have opened up jobs for hardworking Americans. The Swift raids were immediately followed by long lines of Americans applying for a job.

Workplace enforcement is the critical element of Attrition Through Enforcement. If your administration vigorously pursues identity theft crimes and continues to arrest illegal aliens who steal Americans' names and Social Security numbers, you will make real progress against illegal immigration.

This is a good effort. Please back it up with more.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
