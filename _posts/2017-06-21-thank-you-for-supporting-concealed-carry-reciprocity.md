Thank you for your support of the concealed carry reciprocity bill (H.R. 38).

Because this bill is very important to me, I hope that you will do two things:

- Encourage your fellow members to cosponsor this bill.
- Urge the House leadership to take it up and pass it without weakening amendments.

If there is anything that we can learn from the tragic event in Alexandria is that potential victims need to be armed.

As stated in The Wall Street Journal recently:

> “Had Rep. Scalise and his security team not been present, congressman and their aides would have been easy pickings until local police arrived.”

“It would have been a bloodbath,” said Rep. Joe Barton, one of the cosponsors of the bill.

Thank you again for your support of this important legislation.
