While open borders advocates maintain that illegal aliens are less likely to commit a crime, this statistic --- while disingenuous bordering on false due the fact that many law enforcement encounters do not inquire or report about the immigration status of criminals --- also masks another truth: increasing the number of potential illegal alien criminals entering the country will increase the number of Americans and legal immigrants impacted by it.
