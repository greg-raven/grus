New York City Mayor Adams is overwhelmed by busloads of migrants coming from the border. Cities closer to the border have been overwhelmed for months. There is nothing “compassionate” about facilitating a border crisis. End asylum fraud, catch and release, and the abuse of parole authority. Reinstate and mandate the Migration Protection Protocols program.

Sincerely,

[Greg Raven](https://www.gregraven.org/), Apple Valley, CA

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
