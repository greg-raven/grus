I am concerned about America's endangered species, which are being driven toward extinction because of our population growth. The plight of our plants and animals will not improve without the gradual transition to population stabilization.

Our nation's relentless population growth has led to the development of millions of acres of natural lands. America's population has soared to 336 million today, with Â¾ of our land area becoming used for agriculture. To make matters worse. according to the U.S. Census Bureau, our country is poised to add another 70 million people by 2060 --- with roughly 90% due to immigration.

That's why I'm urging you to support both the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2) and the Nuclear Family Priority Act (H.R. 7833), which are critically important to regain control over our nation's unprecedented, and unsustainable, rate of immigration.

Sincerely,

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
