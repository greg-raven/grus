Immigration-driven population growth is lowering our quality-of-life.

According to a recent *Washington Post* article (4/10/24), as America's population grows, and urban areas expand across our nation, we are losing our access to nature. This is tragic because people need contact with nature to maintain physical and mental health.

The demands of our growing population are outstripping the supply of open spaces. This relentless growth has been primarily a result of Congress' unwillingness to address our immigration policies. The Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will add 70 million people by the Year 2060, with roughly 90 percent due to immigration.

Please work to reduce immigration-driven population growth by supporting legislation that limits chain migration (H.R. 7833) and secures our nation's borders (H.R. 2). These steps will put a stop to our persistent loss of open spaces and promote a higher quality-of-life.
