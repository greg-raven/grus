H.R. 1 will make it more difficult for citizens to speak their minds --- please oppose it!

H.R. 1 would discourage citizens from participating in our Democracy by establishing blanket rules for public advocacy groups. Should Congress really be discouraging citizens from engaging with their elected officials?

I urge you to oppose H.R. 1 and encourage more participation in our political process, not less!
