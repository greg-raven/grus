I cannot understand why the new "Standards for Immigration Reform" include virtually every point of the Democrats' amnesty plans. How does it help the American people to legalize 11-18 million illegal aliens and give them work permits to boot? These are not the immigration "standards" the American people want or deserve.  
  
I keep hearing that the party's new "immigration principles" that were developed at the recent GOP retreat are not an amnesty. This statement is a total farce and isn't fooling anyone. There are 20 million Americans who cannot find a full-time job and your party's immigration framework is an amnesty because it allows 11-18 million illegal aliens to remain in the United States to take U.S. jobs. This is an amnesty because they receive the benefits they broke the law to attain.

With the November elections fast approaching, I thought your party would be seeking to differentiate itself from the Democrats. However, it seems your party is in lockstep with them on this issue.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
