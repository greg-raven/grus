It is alarming how our border crisis over the past few years is enabling business interests to push Black and Hispanic workers to the sidelines in favor of bringing in citizens of other countries to compete with them.

Please value our minority workers by ending asylum and parole abuse, blocking catch and release policies, and mandating E-Verify.

Sincerely,
