It is outlandish that amnestied illegal aliens are not forced to pay as part of the Schumer-Rubio-McCain amnesty bill. I hope you will oppose this bill!

Unfortunately, under the terms of the legislation, illegal aliens who have not previously paid any income taxes will not be forced to pay back taxes in order to receive their amnesty. Page 68 of the bill states:

"An alien may not file an application for registered provisional immigrant status under paragraph (1) unless the applicant has satisfied any applicable Federal tax liability...."

The bill continues by stating "the term 'applicable Federal tax liability' means all Federal income taxes assessed in accordance with section 6203 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986."

It's clear that this bill was written in such a way so that illegal aliens have the easiest possible path to getting an amnesty. Please oppose it.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. These amnesties are on the path to national suicide. We must return to pre-1965 immigration law, secure our borders, and evict those who should not be here, including "anchor babies."
