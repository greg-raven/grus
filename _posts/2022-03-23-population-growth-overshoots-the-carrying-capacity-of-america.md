America’s high immigration rates push us beyond carrying capacity.

March 13 will be U.S. “Overshoot Day,” which is based on how large a population and how much human activity can be sustained before the environment’s carrying capacity is exceeded. As our nation’s population grows, it takes fewer days for the U.S. to consume its calculated share of resources. To halt this trend, America’s population growth must slow down.

By 2060, less than 40 years from now, the Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population will expand from 333 million today to 404 million, and 90% of this growth will be due to immigration. We are headed in the opposite direction of achieving population stabilization, as advocated by the Task Force on Population and Consumption, which was created by President Clinton in 1996.

Rather than further exceed our carrying capacity with relentless population growth, America should strive to achieve a sustainable society and serve as an example to the rest of the world. Please work to stabilize the U.S. population, which can only be done with legislation to reduce immigration levels.
