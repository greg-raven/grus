As a Second Amendment supporter, I am writing to express my gratitude for your No votes on H.R. 8 and H.R. 1112.

These extreme gun-control bills will make criminals out of law-abiding Americans. They will also make it harder for good people like me to defend my family. Criminals, on the other hand, will continue to get their firearms the way they always have --- through the black market, theft, and straw purchases. Forcing more government paperwork and additional fees on good people trying to exercise a constitutional right will do nothing to make Americans safer.

Again, I appreciate you standing strong in defense of the Second Amendment.
