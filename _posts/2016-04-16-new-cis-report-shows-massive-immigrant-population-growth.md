A new report from the Center for Immigration Studies shows that immigrants and their children now represent 18.9% of the U.S. population. This represents a drastic increase from 1970, when immigrants and their children represented 6.6% of the population. Current immigration levels are far above America’s historic average and need to be decreased. On top of this, a new Bloomberg poll shows that 61% of Americans believe current immigration levels jeopardize the United States. I hope you will read the report and the poll results and act to reduce immigration to sustainable levels.  
  
Between 1970 and 2015, the America’s population increased by 59%. During the same period, the immigrant population increased by 353%. This is a massive increase by itself, but many states have fared much worse. For example, Georgia’s immigrant population has increased by an eye-watering 3,058% during this period, while the total state population has only increased by 122%.

A skyrocketing population causes strain on all facets of American life. Urban sprawl increases, causing America’s beloved green spaces to be replaced by highways, subdivisions, and strip malls. An increase in the population puts a greater strain on the environment by increasing the amount of power that needs to be created, the volume of water pulled from the water table, and the number of cars on the road. This massive increase also makes it more difficult for Americans to find work. Businesses simply cannot create enough jobs to keep up with immigration-driven population growth.

Americans understand the necessity of bringing America’s sky-high immigration numbers down from the current unsustainable level of 1.5 million per year to the historic average of 250,000 per year. A new Bloomberg poll shows that 61% of Americans believe immigration current immigration levels jeopardize the country.

I hope you will look at the report’s findings and take action to decrease immigration levels.
