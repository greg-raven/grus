I appreciate that you are protecting American workers.

I am glad that you are taking concrete steps to help jobless Americans get back to work! The United States imports millions of foreign workers each year and it makes no sense for this to continue while 40 million Americans are out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Suspending the H-1B, H-2B, J-1, and L1 visa programs will stop less-expensive foreign workers competing against jobless Americans who deserve a living wage.

Thank you for suspending these visa categories; I know that this action will have a positive impact on countless Americans and their families. Please continue to take executive action that prevents businesses from hiring low-cost foreign workers instead of jobless Americans.
