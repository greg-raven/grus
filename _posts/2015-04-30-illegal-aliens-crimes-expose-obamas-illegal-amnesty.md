A new Washington Times article by Stephen Dinan highlights the dangers of Barack Obama's failed --- and illegal --- immigration policies:

> As the Obama administration prepares for a new surge of illegal immigrant children this year, some of those from previous waves are turning up on court dockets across the country, charged with serious crimes such as capital murder and aggravated rape.
>
> The cases are exposing many of the holes in the immigration system and the way the U.S. has tried to grapple with children fleeing economic troubles, domestic abuse or gang violence in Central America --- and sometimes bringing those very troubles to the U.S. with them.
>
> From the law, which requires most of the children to be turned over to social workers, to immigration authorities and the court system, which allow most of them to abscond, never showing up to be deported, to the lack of a safety net to help the children once they're free in the country, the cases suggest a broken process nearly from start to finish, with some children getting lost in the system and others being released because of overcrowding, only to reappear when they're called before a judge to answer for a bigger crime.
>
> "The eagerness of the administration to open our borders is not without consequence," said Rep. Duncan Hunter, a California Republican who has tracked the issue. "Now we're seeing some of these same minors in the criminal justice system, and the crimes some are being brought in for are very serious, even heinous. The administration, with their approach, wants to assume everyone that shows up on America's doorstep has good intentions, but that's a dangerous assumption, and we're seeing evidence of the fact."
>
> The administration admits it was overwhelmed by last summer's surge, which officials said caught them by surprise, with more than 60,000 so-called "unaccompanied minors" --- children traveling without a parent --- streaming across the border in fiscal year 2014. The pace is picking up once again heading into the warmer months of 2015, according to the latest government statistics, and though it's down from 2014's frenetic rate, it's still shaping up as the second-worst year on record.
>
> Oftentimes the children don't even sneak into the country but instead boldly seek out a Border Patrol agent to turn themselves in to, trusting that generous laws, crowded courts and bureaucratic confusion will give them a chance to disappear into the shadows ...
