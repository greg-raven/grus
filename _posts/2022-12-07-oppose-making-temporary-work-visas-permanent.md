- Keep H-1B visas ‘TEMPORARY’ — Vote NO on H.R. 3648

The House of Representatives will soon hold a vote on H.R. 3648, the EAGLE Act. I cannot understand how anyone can think that this bill is a good idea. H.R. 3648 would expand the H-1B program and permanently reduce the number of jobs available to American workers by turning virtually all nonimmigrant visas into a direct path to a green card for foreign workers and their spouses and children, including adult children, regardless of the numerical limits on employment-based green cards.

This bill would would circumvent the current H-1B visa cap, make American workers ineligible for an ever-growing number of U.S. jobs, and give temporary foreign workers the expectation of permanent residency and a path to citizenship. How can any right-thinking Member of Congress think that this legislation’s passage is in the best interests of American workers?

Please protect American workers and protect the temporary nature of nonimmigrant visa programs by opposing H.R. 3648, the EAGLE Act.

Sincerely,
