I must admit that I have no idea why you support the anti-American worker, anti-American student DREAM Act amnesty. However, I hope you realize that a jobs depression is the wrong time to try to force this legislation through Congress.  
  
22 million Americans cannot find a job and neither the economy nor the job market shows any sign of improving in the near or distant future. The DREAM Act amnesty will only make it that much more difficult for these unemployed Americans (native born and legal immigrants alike) to find jobs.

I urge you to reconsider your support for the DREAM Act amnesty during these trying times. The American people are counting on Congress to improve, on harm, our lives. Please don’t let us down.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Your policies have the U.S. going over a cliff. Can’t you at least take your foot off the gas? Your actions seem treasonous.
