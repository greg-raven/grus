I am relieved that you signed the Secure Fence Act into law, but I am discouraged that you still insist on a giant guestworker program for illegal aliens.

Your plan to match "willing workers" with "willing employers" is far from rational. There are 12-20 million illegal aliens currently living in the country. There are millions of people around the world who are waiting to get in. We can assume that almost all of them would qualify as "willing workers."

Sadly, there are more and more employers who are "willing" to employ illegal workers and pay them bottom-of-the-barrel wages. The more you encourage this illegal workforce, the more employers will be forced to hire illegal workers to compete.

Meanwhile, American workers get squeezed out of their wages and occupations --- not because they aren't "willing" to work, but because they cannot support their families on depressed wages. A guestworker program, along the lines of what you have endorsed, would be disastrous for the "willing" American worker.

Please drop your support for this unfair, irrational, and immoral guestworker plan.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
