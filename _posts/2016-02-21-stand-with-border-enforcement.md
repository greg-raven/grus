It is truly disturbing that the Obama administration has given orders to Border Patrol agents that run contrary to federal law. Not only is it unlawful, but it is immoral and indefensible to order agents who arrest illegal aliens to release them without giving them a Notice to Appear. The administration has every right to be embarrassed that only half of illegal aliens given these notices eventually appear in court, but simply allowing illegal aliens to remain in the country without so much as a hearing is unlawful and jeopardizes our nation's security. Brandon Judd, the president of the National Border Patrol Council, testified before the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday and his comments were truly disturbing. Judd testified that the Obama administration has ordered Border Patrol agents to release detained illegal aliens without Notices to Appear because they are simply ignored. Judd continued: "Not only do we release these individuals that by law are subject to removal proceedings, we do it without any means of tracking their whereabouts. Agents believe this exploitable policy was set in place because DHS was embarrassed at the sheer number of those who choose not to follow the law by showing up for their court appearances. In essence, we pull these persons out of the shadows and into the light just to release them right back to those same shadows from whence they came." I urge you to look into these matters, especially after news reports have indicated that violent drug gangs like MS-13 are expanding their reach. Please investigate these developments and take steps to ensure our country's security remains in tact.
