America is experiencing a "biodiversity crisis," which has been confirmed by the U.S. EPA's list of endangered and threatened wildlife, now exceeding a mind-boggling 1,300 species. Habitat loss, and the consequential habitat fragmentation, are the primary reasons for this crisis, and America's high population growth is driving these conditions. All this will become much worse if America grows by another 75 million in 40 years, as predicted by the U.S. Census Bureau, with more than 90% of this increase coming from immigration.

It would be far more sustainable to cut immigration levels in half to a half-million per year as recommended by the bi-partisan U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by former Democratic Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, in 1995. That rate change would bring us back to what was the norm during the 1980s.

To protect our environment and biodiversity of life, we need to lower America's growth rate. I'm urging you to reduce immigration-driven population growth (e.g., eliminate chain migration) through a humane system that respects the dignity of every person.

Sincerely,

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
