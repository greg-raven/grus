A majority of Americans oppose amnesty for illegal aliens. Please keep this in mind and stand against any effort to support H.R. 371, the AgJOBS amnesty.

To provide just one example, agricultural experts have estimated that with machines replacing humans to pick the raisins, labor demand will "drop to a tenth of the 40,000 to 50,000 workers typically hired today." 

Some growers have already stopped hiring seasonal workers (many of whom are illegal) in lieu of machines. 

I encourage you to keep this trend in mind as you consider H.R. 371, the AgJOBS amnesty. There has been no congressional debate yet this session over a proposed farmworker amnesty and these facts should certainly be considered before "legalizing" upwards of three million illegal aliens. 

In light of this, the introduction of H.R. 371, a bill that would grant upwards of three million illegal aliens amnesty seems irresponsible. How can we consider importing additional foreign workers at a time when current workers are facing increased job competition? 

Instead, we should be focusing on the Attrition Through Enforcement solution to illegal immigration --- increased workplace enforcement and elimination of rewards for illegal aliens.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction.
