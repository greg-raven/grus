I’ve just learned that Congress is using procedural trickery to fast-track socialized healthcare in Resident Obama’s revised budget. This kind of underhanded and deceitful tactic muzzles opposition debate, and keeps American taxpayers in the dark! Furthermore, the reason there is a health care crisis in America today is because of government intervention. As P. J. O’Rourke said, “If you think health care is expensive now, wait until you see what it costs when it’s free!” The solution is to get government out of health care, NOT adding more government interference.  
  
I demand that you stand up against such moves, pushing instead for greater transparency and fiscal responsibility.

Say “no” to so-called fast-track measures. Say “no” to socialized healthcare.

Sincerely,
