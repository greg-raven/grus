RE: Time-Sensitive Investigation of Obama's Fraudulent Petition

Evidence suggests Resident Barack Obama may have been born in what is now Kenya (Africa) rather than Hawaii, as he claims. But the United States Constitution clearly says only a "natural born citizen" may be elected President.

I ask that you do your duty by fully investigating whether Barack Obama committed perjury, or violated another state law, in California by falsely claiming that he was constitutionally eligible to serve as President of the United States!

It is critical that your office fully investigate whether Obama was born in Hawaii or not, for the answer to this question is the crux of the matter, and is of the utmost importance for the resolution of this extremely important Constitutional issue.

Your duty as State Attorney General requires you to fully and faithfully enforce the laws of California. If Obama did indeed falsify his nomination papers --- as appears likely --- he must be brought to account in California. I will be watching your actions on this matter very closely.

Thank you.
