Constitutional rights cannot be denied without due process of law. But that’s exactly what the Obama administration is doing. Mismatched fingerprints, spelling errors and duplicate names mean thousands of law-abiding Americans are wrongly flagged as criminals and denied the right to buy a gun.

Under the law, wrongly-denied buyers can appeal their denial, but the NICS Section, the office in charge of background checks, has halted the appeals process alto­ gether.

That’s why Congressman Tom Emmer has introduced H.R. 4980, the Firearm Due Process Protection Act. It forces the government to hear appeals and report to Congress on their flawed NICS database.

Please cosponsor and vote for H.R. 4980, the Firearm Due Process Protection Act.

Sincerely,
