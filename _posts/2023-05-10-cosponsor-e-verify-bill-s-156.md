Please cosponsor S. 156, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act, as Title 42 ends and our border crisis worsens.

It is troubling that migrant surges are occurring as Title 42 ends and our border patrol and communities have already been overwhelmed with the current crisis.

NBC News warned on April 27 that:

> "... when the Title 42 Covid ban ends May 11, a surge of potentially record size will begin" while "border officials are already short on space and money ..."

The worsening border crisis could be stopped with mandatory E-Verify. I urge you to cosponsor S. 156.
