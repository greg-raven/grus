Thank you for your vote in favor of H.R. 6061.

I believe the most important thing you can do to address the common Democratic complaint that Republicans can't be taken seriously about wanting to control illegal immigration as long as they don't go after the hiring of illegal aliens, is to mandate verification of all new hires at all businesses.

This is probably is the most important measure you can pass to control illegal immigration. Please don't put it off any longer.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. American business must hire Americans. Period!
