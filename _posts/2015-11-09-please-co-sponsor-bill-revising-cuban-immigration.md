The immigration laws passed by Congress after the Cuban revolution are now being abused by many Cubans to abuse America's welfare system. Rep. Paul Gosar's Ending Special National Origin-Based Immigration Programs for Cubans Act of 2015 would end the "wet foot/dry foot" policy and repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966. Please cosponsor this legislation.

According to extensive investigative reporting carried out by the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, many Cubans are not coming to the U.S. for our freedoms, but for the welfare checks. Javier Carreoso, aide to former U.S. Rep. David Rivera, told the paper, "They're taking benefits from the American taxpayer to subsidize their life in another country."

Interviews with Cuban immigrants bear out this fact. "It wasn't that bad in Cuba. But here, I'm better." said Jose Angel Rodriguez, 81, who now gets food stamps, Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income payments at his daughter's home in Miami. This view is supported by Juan Fleites, who visits Cuba every two to three months on money saved from his American welfare checks: "This is the greatest country in the world."

These are just two of the numerous Cuban immigrants who abuse our welfare and immigration laws. This abuse is made easy by the special immigration laws for Cubans passed after the Cuban Revolution.

Rep. Gosar's Ending Special National Origin-Based Immigration Programs for Cubans Act of 2015 would end the abuse by repealing the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 and ending the "wet foot/dry foot" policy that allows Cubans to stay in the U.S. as legal immigrants if they touch dry land. I hope you will cosponsor this legislation and help to end this abuse.
