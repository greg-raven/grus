Thank you for your administration's decision to rescind the DAPA program and the extended DACA program that were put in place by President Obama. While it is disappointing that any president would actively seek to subvert U.S. law and the will of Congress, I am glad that you have made sure that they will not take effect.

While I am glad that these programs have been ended, I am disappointed that you have not yet ended the original DACA program, which has given more than 750,000 illegal aliens amnesty and continues to reward illegal aliens for coming to the U.S. illegally. One of your major campaign promises was to end the program and many Americans expect you to come through on this promise.

Giving any rewards to illegal aliens is just plain wrong and only encourages future illegal immigration. Thank you for ending these programs and please act soon to end the full DACA program.
