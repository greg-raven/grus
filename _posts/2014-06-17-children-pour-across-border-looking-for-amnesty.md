Border Patrol estimates that more than 90,000 unaccompanied children from Central America will make the dangerous trek to enter the United States illegally this year. This could end up being a crisis of epic proportion, and it's all due to our nation's failure to enforce federal immigration laws, while providing protections for those already here illegally.

Two years ago, the Obama administration issued a set of memos outlining priorities for immigration enforcement, including deferred action and work permits for illegal aliens who came to the country as children. Those actions were followed up this spring with reports that the administration was further evaluating enforcement priorities that would ultimately protect nearly all illegal aliens living in the U.S. from removal.

Those actions are being reported in countries south of our border, and thousands of children have decided now is the time to come to the U.S. illegally. Instead of discussing ways to end these incentives and enforce existing laws, many in Congress want to pass "comprehensive immigration reform" that would grant amnesty to millions of illegal aliens and double legal immigration.

Our country continues to fight its way out of a terrible jobs recession with 18 million Americans looking for full-time work. Further, working households have seen their wages decline in recent years. Amnesty and increased immigration will only make matters worse by adding more competition to the job market and depressing wages. Please help America's unemployed and end the crisis on the border by choosing enforcement over amnesty and immigration increases.

Call me if you want to talk about this.
