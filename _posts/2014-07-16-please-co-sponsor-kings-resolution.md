Very shortly, Rep. Steve King will introduce a resolution that urges border state governors to call out the National Guard to help secure the border. I hope you will contact Rep. King’s office and tell him you want to be an original cosponsor.

President Obama has refused to secure the border and refused to enforce immigration laws. He and his administration have actively sought to give legal status and shelter to illegal aliens. This only serves to encourage illegal immigration and the current border surge is proof of that. The resolution makes this clear by stating:

“Whereas the President, the Secretary of Homeland Security, and the Administration have enacted unconstitutional policies, such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program and the Morton Memos, that have contributed significantly to a massive increase in illegal immigration;

“Whereas the President has not secured the Southwest international border of the United States;”

I hope you will support this resolution. The National Guard needs to be called out and the American people need to see how President Obama has caused this disaster.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. A nation without borders is not a nation!
