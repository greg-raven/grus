Provide funding to continue immigration enforcement.

The House and Senate are working to pass the budget reconciliation and it is imperative that the additional border and immigration enforcement funds in each of the bills are present in the final version so that the President and his administration have the tools they need to secure the border and fully enforce our immigration laws. 

Please do all you can to ensure that the additional funding (up to $200 billion) is approved so that the Department of Homeland Security can continue its important work.
