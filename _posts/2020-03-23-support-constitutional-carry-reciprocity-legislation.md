Have you cosponsored the concealed carry reciprocity bill?

As a result of concern over the Coronavirus, law enforcement offices all over the country are shutting down all or part of their operations --- including processing concealed carry permit applications.

While the inability to purchase and carry a firearm may not seem important to some, for battered women and people harassed by stalkers, it may be a matter of life and death.

This is why 17 states have adopted laws recognizing the constitutional right of citizens to protect themselves without getting the government’s permission --- a recognition which is called "Constitutional Carry." It is also why Congress must pass legislation to extend this right past state borders.

That legislation is H.R. 38 in the House and S. 69 in the Senate.

This is particularly important for battered women who do not want their batterers knocking on their door --- or worse.

But it is just common sense that constitutionally-protected lawful conduct should not become a felony simply because the law-abiding gun owner takes the wrong ramp off of an Interstate.

Sometime between now and the end of Congress, there will come a time when current events push the Second Amendment to the center of Congress’ agenda. When that happens, I would urge you to force a vote on H.R. 38 and/or S. 69.

Gun Owners of America will keep me informed as to what happens on this important issue.
