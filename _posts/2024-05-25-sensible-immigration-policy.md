May 26, 2024 marks the 100th anniversary of the Immigration Act of 1924.

The 1924 Immigration Act set the groundwork for the Great Leveling of American incomes, making America a middle-class nation for the first and only time by ending the Great Wave of Immigration.

While the 1965 Immigration Act corrected the discriminatory national origin quotas of the 1924 Act, the 1965 Act also sent immigration numbers to record levels.

A better immigration system would give Americans a fair, non-discriminatory system with sustainable limits.

I would like the opportunity to talk more with you about better and sensible immigration limits to restore our middle class.
