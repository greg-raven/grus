Thanks for voting against H.R. 6800!

H.R. 6800, the American job-destroying HEROES Act, is a terrible bill and I’m glad you voted against it. I cannot understand the rationale behind importing 1.4 million foreign medical workers when American doctors and nurses are being laid off and furloughed. Moreover, with 36 million Americans out of work, I don’t understand why so many of your colleagues want to give amnesty and money to millions of illegal aliens. This will only harm working-class Americans.

Thank you for opposing this bill and please do all you can to help jobless Americans get back to work.
