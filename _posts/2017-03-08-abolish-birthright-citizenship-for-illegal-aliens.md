Birthright citizenship is an outdated practice that lures foreign nationals to the United States so their unborn children can become U.S. citizens. Please work to end this policy that most industrialized nations have already abandoned.

8 U.S.C. 1401 : U.S. Code --- Section 1401 currently says that "a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth." Clearly, the Constitution does not need to be changed in order to prevent the children of illegal aliens from receiving birthright citizenship; a simple piece of legislation will do.

The United States is almost the only industrialized nation to still practice jus soli --- birthright citizenship. I expect you to help America get with the times by supporting legislation that would change our nation's laws and prevent the children of illegal aliens from receiving birthright citizenship. When this is done, illegal aliens will have one less anchor keeping them in this country, thereby opening up millions of jobs for America's unemployed.
