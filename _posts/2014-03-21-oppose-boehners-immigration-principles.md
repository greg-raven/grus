Why is Roll Call saying that you haven't decided whether to support Speaker Boehner's "immigration principles?" These principles would devastate American workers and should not be supported. I hope you will make it clear that you actually oppose these principles.

These immigration principles are nearly identical to the principles behind S. 744, the Senate-passed Obama-Schumer amnesty. The non-partisan CBO said that this legislation would increase unemployment and decrease wages. Why would you even consider supporting principles that would make it harder for Americans to find work and decrease the pay of those who are lucky enough to find a job?

I hope you will decide to oppose the Speaker's principles and the Democrats' war on American workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
