I would be grateful if you were to consider cosponsoring H.R. 692, the Nuclear Family Priority Act.  
  
Ending chain migration was one of the top recommendations of Democratic leader Barbara Jordan when she chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform. She concluded that chain migration serves no compelling national interest while harming the Americans who most need our help.

While ending chain migration would directly reduce overall immigration by around 1.2 million a decade, it would eventually and indirectly lead to an even larger decline in other categories. The creation of the chain migration categories has been the primary reason total authorized immigration has skyrocketed from 2.5 million per decade to 10 million.

22 million Americans cannot find a job. Reducing chain migration would help some of these Americans find jobs. Please support H.R. 692, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, and help Americans get back to work!

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
