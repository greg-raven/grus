The just-released FBI background check of Judge Brett Kavanaugh confirms what everyone already knew: He is fit to serve on the Supreme Court. You must vote to confirm Kavanaugh, period. While Judge Kavanaugh has been a paragon of knowledge and wisdom, his accusers have been shown not only to have no credibility, but also to have no limit as to how low they will go in their baseless attacks on him. Sadly, this latter group includes some senators. Facts and truth matter. Therefore, you must vote to confirm Kavanaugh.
