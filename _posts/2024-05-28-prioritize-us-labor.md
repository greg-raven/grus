Work permits will only worsen the border crisis. Prioritize U.S. labor

It is troubling that business leaders are in talks with the Biden administration about issuing work permits to allow them to obtain cheaper, foreign labor which is present in the U.S. illegally to rebuild following the Francis Scott Key Bridge tragedy.

This tragedy should not allow these exploitative employers to bypass U.S. labor and depress wages.

I urge you to oppose attempts by the Biden administration to extend work permits to illegal workers through temporary protected status (TPS) and humanitarian parole.

Please contact me to discuss how you can prioritize U.S. workers and wages following this tragedy.
