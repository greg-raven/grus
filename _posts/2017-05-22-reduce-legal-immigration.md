I was concerned by your recent statements to the Economist where you said that you did not want to reduce legal immigration levels. These statements contradict your Joint Address to Congress when you said, “Protecting our workers also means reforming our system of legal immigration. The current, outdated system depresses wages for our poorest workers, and puts great pressure on taxpayers.”

It’s impossible to protect the wages of American workers and relieve the pressure on taxpayers while increasing or even maintaining current immigration levels. In order for immigration to serve the national interest and be a benefit for workers, the numbers must be reduced to more traditional levels.

Sen. Tom Cotton’s RAISE Act would cut legal immigration by 50% and accomplish the goals of a merit-based system. Please work with Sen. Cotton on turning this legislation into law.

Call me if you want to talk about this,
