Late last year, you announced a set of executive actions on immigration that will grant work permits to up to 5 million illegal aliens. Further, your actions will make it easier for illegal-alien tech workers to remain in the country. Have you considered the impact of these actions on struggling American workers? I urge you to place the concerns of American workers and legal immigrants already here ahead of illegal aliens.

In your 2006 book, *The Audacity of Hope,* you wrote:

> “The number of immigrants added to the labor force every year is of a magnitude not seen in this country for over a century (and) threatens to depress further the wages of blue-collar Americans and put strains on an already overburdened safety net.”

These words were true in 2006, and, as we continue to recover from the Great Recession, they’re even more true today. Yet, your immigration executive actions will grant work permits to 5 million illegal aliens, allowing them to compete with blue-collar Americans for nearly every job. This will only continue to depress wages for American workers while creating more job competition for a limited number of jobs. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the number of Americans not in the labor force is at a level not seen in decades.

Further, adding 5 million, mostly low-skilled, wage earners will surely add unnecessary strain to our social welfare system. It’s unlikely that these individuals will contribute enough in taxes to equal what they’ll use in public services, and some estimates say that your actions will cost American taxpayers $2 trillion.

I urge you to reconsider the impacts of your actions on American workers and stop any plans of granting work permits to millions of illegal aliens.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Not that you care about America or Americans, being an illegal alien yourself, and a gluttonous, ungrateful one at that.
