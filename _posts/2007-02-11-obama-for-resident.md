Today's paper reports that Barack Obama "announced his bid for president Saturday, a black man evoking Abraham Lincoln's ability to unite a nation." I don't know which is more frightening: That the AP reporters and editors who produced this story are insane, or Obama is and no one else has yet noticed it.

Obama would be like Lincoln (and, to be fair, just about every other politician) in saying one thing and meaning or doing another. Just as one example, there's his [January 22, 2006, statement during a Meet the Press interview](https://www.nbcnews.com/id/wbna10909406) that he would not run for president in 2008. This was just over one year ago.

At that time, it was "silly" to speak of such matters, and he thought he had made himself perfectly clear. Keep that in mind as you listen to him in the future.

And even though Lincoln was a Republican and Obama is a Democrat, there isn't a dime's worth of difference between the two these days, so that's another potential similarity.

But one trembles to think that Obama may actually be serious in his goal to "unite a nation." As a Muslim, he may be referring to the Nation of Islam, but most persons here in the U.S. probably believe he means our nation.

In which case, Obama is insane.

Lincoln was such a megalomaniac that, despite his previous utterances about states' rights, he helped push this country into a Civil War that cost two percent of our population (600,000 dead). (Keep in mind that the Civil War was never about freeing slaves --- it was about crushing states' rights. Freeing the slaves was an afterthought.)

During this Civil War, he suspended habeas corpus, and was ruthless with his political opponents in the northern states. After the war, he further trampled the rule of law by forcing the seceded southern states to vote in favor of Constitutional amendments in order to be reinstated into the Union. That is, they were not members of the Union, but as the occupied losers of the Civil War, they had to vote in favor of the amendments, even though they had no standing to do so. Breathtaking, huh? To this day, we are still suffering under Lincoln's expansion of the Federal government at the expense of state and individual rights.

On the race issue, Lincoln [pretty much hated negroes and any thought of race-mixing between whites and negroes](https://www.ihr.org/jhr/v13/v13n5p-4_Morgan.html). (Maybe Obama does, too, but I doubt he'll be saying anything along those lines any time soon.) Lincoln for years pushed to resettle all the negroes in Africa (Liberia).

Maybe Obama feels akin to Lincoln because he feels he has good intentions, so the end results don't really matter. Buy your waders now, because as this typically Liberal mindset takes even more hold of our body politic, there will be blood in the streets.
