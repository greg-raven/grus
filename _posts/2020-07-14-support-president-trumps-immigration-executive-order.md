Support the president's immigration EO to prevent new foreign workers taking post-pandemic jobs.

I am glad that the president is taking concrete steps to help jobless Americans get back to work! The United States imports more than one million new foreign workers each year and it makes no sense for this to continue while 40 million Americans are out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Suspending the H-1B, H-2B, J-1, and L1 visa programs will stop less-expensive foreign workers competing against jobless Americans who deserve a living wage.

I hope you agree that President Trump's executive order will have a positive impact on countless Americans and their families. I hope you and your colleagues will pass legislation that prevents businesses from hiring low-cost foreign workers instead of jobless Americans.
