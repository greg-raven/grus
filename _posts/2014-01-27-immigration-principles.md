I have ready in many newspapers that Congress is coming up with "immigration principles." This can be a positive development if the correct principles are agreed upon. I hope you will accept this as an immigration principle:

Promoting the National Interest
: Just as every other country has immigration policies to protect its own citizens, the purpose of U.S. immigration policy should be to advance the national interest in benefitting the citizens of the United States. If this is not done, our nation will be harmed.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
