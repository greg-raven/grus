It is concerning that some of your colleagues attempted to use the DHS appropriations bill to raise H-2 visa caps. As H-2B visas typically cover seasonal, entry-level, or unskilled jobs, these visas disproportionately harm young Americans. Increasing H-2B visa numbers would prevent thousands more young Americans from entering the workplace.

According to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly half of all working-age Americans with less than a high school degree are out of work. It's these American workers who directly compete with H-2B visa holders for jobs.

Investigative reports have shown that businesses are more than willing to fire American workers when H-2B workers become available. It's clear that the H-2B program, which is fraught with abuse, harms Americans and should not be expanded. Please do all you can to ensure that American and legal immigrant workers are protected from any additional competition from low-cost temporary foreign workers.
