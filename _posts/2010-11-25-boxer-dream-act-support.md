We truly are disappointed that you have decided to support the DREAM Act amnesty. We thought that, given the recent election, you would be opposing, not supporting, an anti-American amnesty bill.  
  
I urge you to stop paying attention to anyone who says the DREAM Act amnesty will only help innocent "children" who are the victims of their parents' lawbreaking. The DREAM Act is not a narrow amnesty aimed only at children; it would amnesty any illegal alien under the age of 35!

The DREAM Act is not a small amnesty for a select group of individuals. In fact, it allows illegal "teens" (i.e., anyone under 35) to petition for their parents, leading eventually to their aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins coming permanently to the United States.

The big argument for this amnesty is that it is for teenagers who are here illegally because their parents broke the law. Even with the less-than-35 age requirement, this amnesty will apply to more than just teens ("humanitarian" and "family unity" exceptions are added to the age limit). Nonetheless, the argument is that the teenagers should not be punished for the crimes of their parents.

However, as soon as DREAM amnesty citizens are over 21, they can bring their parents, who broke the law to get them into the country in the first place, back into the U.S. (or, keep them here legally after years of avoiding deportation). The chief criminals will be rewarded after all. And due to chain migration, the amnestied "teens" can petition for their aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents to get permanent U.S. residency as well.

This a back-door amnesty for the parents of these illegal "teens," and a chain migration nightmare for the country. I hope you will take the November 2nd election results to heart and observe the will of the American people on this issue. Just say no to Sen. Reid and just say no to this anti-American worker amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. I don't understand why you liberals hate the United States so much. You disgust me.
