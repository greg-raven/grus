Your decision to attach our state's support to efforts to overturn Judge Andrew Hanen's ruling against President Obama's executive amnesties is appalling. Why are you in favor of the president's amnesties when their implementation would keep millions of American workers out of a job?

President Obama's amnesties are an affront to the rule of law and to the 18 million Americans who cannot find a full-time job. When you add in the tens of millions more who have simply stopped looking for work, the president's actions amount to a declaration of war against American workers.

As attorney general, your duty is to our state's workers, especially those who are having trouble finding a full-time job. When people in our state can't find work, it impacts everyone, but especially the families that have a hard time paying the rent or putting food on the table.

I urge you to reconsider your support for the president's executive amnesties. Supporting them only serves to keep more American workers out of a job and encourage more illegal aliens to come to our state.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven

P.S. Is it because Obama himself is an illegal alien, and you refuse to do anything about that? Your job is to enforce the law, not figure out ways of skirting it when it suits your purposes.
