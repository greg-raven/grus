Americans want less immigration, as promised.

Voters delivered a decisive immigration message in November, 2024: immigration is too high and should be reduced.

The historic border crisis of 2021-2025 is part of a longer history of broken promises from Washington to limit immigration to reasonable numbers that the nation can sustain. Sixty years ago, President Johnson signed the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965 by promising that "the days of unlimited immigration are past." He was wrong. Immigration quadrupled over the next three decades and has averaged over a million a year since then.

Americans have been voting for less immigration for decades, and Washington D.C. has given us more, either through "legal" programs or loose enforcement.

I am hopeful that things are changing in Washington, D.C.!

Mass immigration makes housing less affordable, our communities less sustainable, and good jobs less obtainable. After decades of stagnant wages and a declining labor force participation rate, we should make it easier for Americans to find jobs, not harder.

Reduce immigration. Limit family based migration to spouses and minor children. Limit employment based immigration to truly world class talent. Require businesses to use E-Verify to hire authorized workers. Stop selling U.S. citizenship to lottery winners. Stop giving away U.S. citizenship to children of tourists.
