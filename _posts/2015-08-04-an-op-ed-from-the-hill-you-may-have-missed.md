I hope you will take the time to read the attached op-ed from The Hill. Sanctuary cities need to be eliminated and this article makes that case well.

Sanctuary cities make our entire country less safe by refusing to hand over illegal aliens to ICE for removal proceedings, even if the illegal aliens have a criminal record. The arrogance of these localities is beyond belief and has resulted in the deaths of innocent Americans. By attempting to protect illegal aliens from deportation, they are knowingly and wantonly harboring dangerous illegal aliens.

Please read the attached op-ed and help to make our country safer by helping to eliminate sanctuary cities.

> It isn't just cities that release criminal foreign citizens with felony convictions into our local communities, often with tragic results like the ones that recently have caught the public and congressional attention.
>
> Yes, Congress must act to defund sanctuary cities until they cooperate with federal enforcement agencies. But Congress must also address the largest sanctuary jurisdiction of all: the federal government.
>
> Federal entities release nearly four times as many criminal aliens as do cities and other local jurisdictions with sanctuary policies. New legislation must include mandatory detainers for criminal aliens as well as mandatory communications between state and local and federal agencies.
