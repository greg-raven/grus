More than 7.7 million illegal aliens have jobs at a time when more than 11.5 million Americans do not. You can help some of these unemployed Americans by ensuring that E-Verify is reauthorized for at least 10 years.

Certain Members of Congress have been using E-Verify as a political football to the detriment of unemployed and underemployed Americans. This political posturing must stop. E-Verify is an effective way of preventing illegal aliens from taking American jobs.

There is currently a movement to attach the reauthorization to the Omnibus Appropriations Bill. Please do all you can to support this effort to reauthorize the E-Verify employment verification system for a period of no less than ten years. There are more than 11.5 million unemployed Americans depending on you.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
