Due to the actions (or inaction) of the Biden administration, the border is out of control and illegal immigration is rampant. Congress must make securing the border and tackling illegal immigration a priority during the remainder of the 117th Congress and during the 118th Congress. Legislation must include:

- Excluding amnesty of any type;
- Creating an authority to expel illegal aliens across the border immediately;
- Mandating and appropriating resources for completion of the border wall system;
- Substantially reforming the asylum system, including clarifying that an alien is ineligible for asylum in the U.S. if they traversed a safe third country;
- Increasing ICE resources for Deportation Officers (DO) and detention beds so they are commensurate with the mandatory detention and removal requirements in the law, and clarifying DO's authority to make custodial arrests;
- Ending the abuse of parole authority;
- Mandating full implementation of the Migrant Protection Protocols (MPP), otherwise known as Remain in Mexico, and appropriating funds for permanent court facilities along the border at every POE;
- Restricting prosecutorial discretion to remove it as the catch-all excuse for limiting immigration enforcement;
- Eliminating discretionary grants of employment authorization under 8 U.S.C. 1324A(h)(3);
- Clarifying that the entry into the U.S. of any alien with known or suspected ties to, or association with, a terrorist entity is prohibited until that alien has been properly vetted and the Secretary has determined that no threat exists;
- Establishing further restrictions on federal court jurisdiction to review claims brought by aliens and their associations/organizations; and
- Reversing Arizona vs. U.S. and giving states independent authority to participate in the enforcement of immigration laws.

I know you and your colleagues understand the seriousness of the problem and I trust you to take all necessary steps to address it.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
