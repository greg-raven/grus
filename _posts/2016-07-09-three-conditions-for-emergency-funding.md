On July 8, Pres. Obama submitted an $3.7 billion emergency funding request to help stop the illegal-alien border surge on the U.S.-Mexico border. Unfortunately, the President's request would only help relieve the symptoms rather than fix the actual causes for the surge. I urge you not to approve any emergency funding unless the following conditions are included.

1. Change the 2008 law so that unaccompanied alien minors from noncontiguous countries are treated the same way those from Mexico and Canada are treated. Under current law, these minors are issued Notices to Appear and then turned over to Health and Human Services, whereas minors from Mexico and Canada are immediately returned to their home country;
2. No foreign aid will be sent to the sending countries until they agree to take back their citizens; and
3. All the extra domestic money should go to the Border Patrol and ICE Enforcement and Removal Operations to detain, process, and remove the illegal crossers. Funding should NOT go to: the Department of Health and Human Services to warehouse illegal crossers; to any agency to transport the border surgers around the U.S.; and certainly not to the "charities" that are paid to resettle refugees in unsuspecting communities.

These three conditions will send a strong message to foreign citizens that illegal entry into the United States will not be tolerated, and thus end the ongoing illegal-alien border surge.

Please ensure each one of these conditions are included in any emergency funding bill before casting your vote.
