Why did you go on CNN's "State of the Union" program and give your support to amnesty legislation? Californians expect you to oppose, not support, an amnesty for illegal aliens!

Any amnesty for illegal alien would cost U.S. taxpayers $2.5 trillion. Is this money well spent? Is this money the American people have? With taxes going up and the prices food, housing, and gasoline skyrocketing, can America really afford an amnesty?

Californians deserve better than the amnestying of illegal aliens. They are already a drain on our economy as it is. Think how much of a drain they would be if they had access to the same services of U.S. citizens and legal aliens. Just say "no" to amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
