Immigration is one of the top issues in exit polls.

Although the midterms were not a referendum on immigration, it may be of more concern in coming elections if nothing is done about the border.

Exit polls made this point clear.

Please work with your colleagues to end our border crisis.

Sincerely,

[Greg Raven](https://www.gregraven.org/), Apple Valley, CA

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. Make E-Verify mandatory.
