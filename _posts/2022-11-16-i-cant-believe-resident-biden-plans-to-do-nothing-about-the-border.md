Immigration is one of the top issues in exit polls.

Although the midterms were not a referendum on immigration, it may be of more concern in coming elections if nothing is done about the border.

Exit polls made this point clear.

Please work with your colleagues to end our border crisis.

Sincerely,

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
