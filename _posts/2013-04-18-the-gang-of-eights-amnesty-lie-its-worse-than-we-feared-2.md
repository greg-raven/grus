The Senate Gang of Eight has finally introduced its Comprehensive Immigration Reform bill, and it's far worse than anything that could have been imagined. And YES, it rewards illegal immigration by granting work permits and (eventually) citizenship to those who entered the country prior to 2012.

It also puts the interests of foreign workers ahead of the interests of American workers by increasing legal immigration by at least 50 percent over the next decade, until the unemployment rate reaches 8.5%. That's higher than the Obama administration believed the unemployment rate would ever reach in the current Great Recession. This does not count people who are underemployed or have given up looking for work. Can you imagine the effect that will have on driving down wages?

Backers of the bill that the bill is not an amnesty. But illegal aliens would be legalized and get work permits, before a single increase in enforcement to stop future illegal immigration.

Supporters claim that illegal aliens would not be eligible for welfare and other benefits. This is only an accounting trick to allow them to exempt the bill from budget rules that require supermajorities for bills that increase the deficit. The truth is that once illegal aliens are granted their green cards years from now, they will qualify for all benefits, including Social Security, welfare, Medicare, Medicaid, and even subsidized Obamacare. The final cost for the bill will be trillions of dollars. Not billions, but trillions.

> "Moreover, even if the bill does contain strong, loophole-free language to this effect, it will only succeed in delaying --- not reducing --- the cost to taxpayer ... Once the present illegal population receives green cards, they will be eligible under current law for a wide array of federal welfare programs including food stamps, Supplemental Security Income, Temporary Assistance for Needy Families, and Medicaid." --- Letter by Sens. Jeff Sessions (R-AL), Chuck Grassley (R-IA), and Pat Roberts (R-KS)

The Gang of 8 must know how indefensible its bill is, because the Gang's strategy is to rush the bill through Congress, before the public can learn about.

The news media will doubtlessly label attempts to slow down the bill as a "filibuster" and will claim that the bill deserves a chance to be heard. How ironic is that? They want to vote on the bill before anyone has a chance to know what's in the bill!

Here are some of the outrageous elements of the bill:

- The bill will slow down immigration increases only if the unemployment rates surpass 8.5 percent.
- Amnestied illegal aliens will qualify as anchors so that their families can legally immigrate; in fact, their whole families will get extra points under the point system.
- The Department of Homeland Security can change the point system at any time, without congressional approval.

This immigration bill is so bad, states the top legal analyst for NumbersUSA, "This is Congress giving away the power to reshape America to the executive branch, with virtually no limit."

Contact your representatives in Congress and let them know in no uncertain terms that they must note support this bill.
