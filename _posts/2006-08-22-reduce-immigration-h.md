It's time to reduce overall immigration numbers.

As a first step, please focus the rest of this Congressional session on getting the House-passed H.R. 4437 signed into law. This will mean insisting that immigration laws be enforced and refusing to accept any compromise that increases immigration numbers.

I'm counting on you to get control of our immigration system and reduce immigration numbers as soon as possible.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Thanks for getting tougher on immigration issues!
