I am a constituent who believes it is unconstitutional and wrong to try to give illegal immigrants in California a guest worker amnesty. Please ensure that AB 1544 is defeated in the Appropriations Committee.  
  
The federal H-2A guest worker program has provided farmers temporary workers for years, but too few use it. That’s because California’s farmers have become addicted to cheap illegal labor.

It is true that black-market labor will work for less than legal labor. So I’m asking you to send a clear message — the rule of law is not for sale in California. Even for agriculture.

With 11 percent unemployment and a $16 billion budget deficit, the legislature should not try to authorize illicit foreign workers or force taxpayers to underwrite a duplicative program that locks in unsustainable welfare commitments to illegal immigrant families. Vote NO on AB 1544.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
