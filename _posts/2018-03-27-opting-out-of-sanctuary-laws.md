I agree with the letter writer who suggested we contact our elected officials to urge them to opt out of California’s “sanctuary” status, much as Los Alamitos has already done in Orange County (*Daily Press,* Letters, March 27, 2018).

In fact, I would go even further.

I recommend that we demand that our local officials direct local law enforcement to enroll in the Immigration and Nationality Act Section 287(g) program, which authorizes the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) to deputize selected state and local law enforcement officers to enforce federal immigration law.

This would allow state and local officers to receive training and work under the supervision of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. Then, local law enforcement would have the authorization to identify, process, and detain immigration offenders they encounter during their regular, daily law-enforcement activity.
