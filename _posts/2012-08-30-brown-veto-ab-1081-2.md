Governor Jerry Brown:

I strongly oppose the legislation (AB1081) that would turn down ICE requests for detaining illegal immigrants unless the individuals are convicted of serious felonies. Voters like me fear the consequences of such a policy and want you to veto the measure.  
  
It is wrong to say that we need this legislation so that illegal immigrants will cooperate with police. Federal law already protects witnesses or crime victims who are unlawfully present in the United States. Congress specifically created a "U" visa so that crime victims could remain in the U.S. to assist law officers.

You backed the Secure Communities proposal as Attorney General because you understood it is critical to identify and deport dangerous aliens. Things certainly haven't improved since then.

It is your duty to protect Californians. Do not accede to the demands of pro-illegal immigrant groups that oppose all immigration enforcement. Listen to the California State Sheriffs' Association and voters like me. Veto AB1081.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
