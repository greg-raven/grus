America’s remaining open spaces, especially our majestic national parks, are being "used to death." As our population grows, parks and beaches cannot keep up with the demand. Unless America can achieve a stable sustainable population, the trampling of our remaining open spaces will worsen. This is why Congress must revisit our immigration policies. The Census Bureau projects the U.S. that 75 million people will be added to America’s population by the Year 2060, with roughly 90 percent of that growth due to immigration.

Nature’s power to rejuvenate the human spirit has been known for many generations. Every one of America’s legendary conservationists (e.g., John Muir) knew that contact with nature is a paramount part of nurturing the soul and spirit of mankind.

We need leaders like you to protect our nation’s dwindling open spaces. Please support legislation that limits chain migration to spouses and minor children, and/or establishes a nationwide E-Verify system. By reducing our population growth, we can guarantee that future generations will have access to our open spaces.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. Make E-Verify mandatory.
