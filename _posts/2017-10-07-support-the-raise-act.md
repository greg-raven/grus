I urge you to support the new RAISE Act introduced by Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue. Recent polling has found that 72% of American voters support a key element of their bill which would eliminate extended family immigration.

The new RAISE Act would end chain migration by eliminating the extended family green card categories. Eliminating these green cards were a key recommendation of the last bipartisan Congressional commission on immigration led by the late Barbara Jordan.

The new RAISE Act would also benefit American workers and boost the economy by ending low-skilled permanent immigration and transforming our employment-based green card system to a merit-based points system, ensuring that only the best and brightest can get green cards.

The late Barbara Jordan said our immigration system should serve the national interest and these reforms would help achieve that. Please put American workers ahead of the special interest groups by supporting the RAISE Act!
