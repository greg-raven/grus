As a California resident, I am writing to express concern about state policies that are contributing to high fuel prices in California.

Each time I fill up my tank, I already pay over a dollar per gallon in California-specific gas taxes and fees, with another tax increase that went into effect on July 1, 2025. California drivers pay the highest gas taxes and fees in the United States, and this is not something I support.

Taxes aren't the only factor driving up gasoline costs. Over the last couple of years, California policies have made oil and gas production and refining difficult to sustain --- local drilling permits have dwindled to 3% of 2019 levels, so more crude oil must be imported. This often leads to higher costs, negatively affects California jobs, and moves production overseas to places with lower environmental standards. In 2024, 75% of the crude oil used in California was imported, and that amount is growing as state energy policies discourage oil production.

Additionally, gasoline demand in California remains steady, decreasing only 1% between 2023 and 2024. If the two California refineries that announced they will cease operations in less than a year follow through with their plans, refining capacity in the state will decrease by nearly 18%. The likely refinery closures mean that the cost of fuel may increase for Californians due to supply and demand economics. This is concerning, as the cost of groceries and other goods may increase because the cost of fuel is often embedded in the prices of those goods. California's energy policies should encourage domestic energy production, refining, and investment, not discourage it.

These rising costs are unsustainable for Californians and businesses.

I urge you to take action by: adopting policies that stabilize the energy industry, encouraging the energy industry to continue its investment in California, and advocating for balanced policy approaches that consider the economic impact on Californians. Please consider the voices of residents like me who are feeling the strain of ever-rising transportation costs.

Thank you for your attention to this pressing issue.
