I urge you to oppose S. 2075, the DREAM Act. Please do not cosponsor this amnesty bill.

S. 2075 provides an amnesty for certain illegal aliens. 

Even though it is an amnesty for a sympathetic subset of illegal aliens, it will reward illegal aliens with full legal status and eventually citizenship and full rights to petition for more immigrants. 

The DREAM Act is a slap in the face to every person who abided by the law and waited their turn and immigrated by following the law. 

That's the point most illegal aliens and would-be illegal aliens will take from this amnesty, not that the Senate was compassionate toward a sympathetic group of illegal aliens.

Hopefully,
