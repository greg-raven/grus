We hope you find the unilateral Obama Amnesty as appalling as we do. This amnesty happened, in part, due to Republican inaction. Republicans must now counter it by passing mandatory E-Verify legislation.

It is particularly irresponsible for President Obama to issue an amnesty for illegal aliens while neither President Obama nor Congress have done anything to reduce the number of Green Cards given out each year to new permanent foreign workers. We have 20 million Americans who can't find a full-time job, and he has just issued an executive order that adds millions of new workers to the labor pool, thus putting even more Americans out of work. Whom exactly does he represent?

If the Republicans in Congress let the president get away with this power grab, where does it end? This is simply the thin end of the wedge and more travesties of justice will surely come. To make matters worse, you Republicans only have yourselves to blame for this. If you had only passed serious immigration enforcement legislation, such as mandatory E-Verify, I am convinced that President Obama would not have taken this action.

It's time for you and your fellow Republicans to show some backbone and pass immigration bills, such as mandatory E-Verify, to mitigate the effects of President Obama's amnesty. Otherwise, Americans will continue to suffer.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
