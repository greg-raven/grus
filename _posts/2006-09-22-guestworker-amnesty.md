I'm tired of your unwavering support of a guestworker-amnesty program.

I am absolutely stunned that while 14 million Americans cannot find full time work, your callous response has been to endorse various amnesties for illegal aliens who have broken our immigration laws and who have taken away job opportunities from those who need them --- and deserve them --- the most. 

Please put aside all talk of an amnesty-guestworker program and focus on border security and enforcement first. 

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
