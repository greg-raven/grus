Representative Paul Cook

I am glad you were elected to the House of Representatives. Please do all you can to reign in America's ridiculous spending. You can help to do this by reducing the number of low-skilled immigrants that America imports, costing U.S. taxpayers $89.1 billion per year.  
  
I always laugh when I hear Democrats give Republicans advice on immigration. They know very well that amnesty and expanded legal immigration will result in an expanded welfare state, which means more Democratic voters. But the fact is the country can't afford more low-skilled immigration, which costs American taxpayers $89 billion a year --- and that's not counting the $4.2 billion in tax refunds that the IRS pays out to illegal aliens every year. Of course, even these amounts are dwarfed by the $2.6 trillion in additional costs due to Obamacare for illegals.

You will probably get a lot of advice from Democrats in Washington who want you to help them pass another amnesty and immigration increase. Just remember, their advice isn't free, it costs us nearly $2.7 trillion.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven

P.S. Please help fight for America and Americans: STOP immigration; STOP increases to the debt ceiling; STOP further infringements on our 2nd Amendment rights; DISMANTLE the welfare state; REPEAL Obamacare.
