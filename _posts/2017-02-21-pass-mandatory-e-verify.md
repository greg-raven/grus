Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security John Kelly issued two memos today that cleared out most of the rubbish of past Administration internal memos and basically declared that federal law enforcement officers are now free to apply any law that Congress passed to discourage illegal immigration.

Roy Beck of NumbersUSA responded to this by saying, “Secretary Kelly’s memos are great news for vulnerable American workers and their families who are supposed to be protected by immigration laws from the competition of an illegal work force. For the first time in five presidencies, ICE agents and Border Patrol will now be allowed and expected to fully enforce the laws that Congress has passed and that they swore an oath to uphold when taking their jobs.”

The new memos will finally allow Border Patrol and ICE agents to do their jobs and enforce the law after years of being forced to turn a blind eye to illegal immigration and criminal-harboring sanctuary cities. American workers will finally be protected from illegal job competition and from the danger posed by criminal aliens.

While this is a promising beginning to Secretary Kelly’s tenure leading DHS, it is concerning that President Obama’s two executive amnesties remain in force, with work permits continuing to be issued to people who have broken America’s laws. This harms American workers and only encourages future illegal immigration.

I hope you will do all you can to support Secretary Kelly’s actions, including making E-Verify mandatory for all employers, and will take steps to prevent any more work permits from being issued to illegal aliens.
