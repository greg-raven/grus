- Mass immigration hasn't delivered a fair economy. Moderate the numbers.

It troubles me that Congress is again entertaining "Dreamer" and farmworker amnesties and the EAGLE Act during the lame-duck session instead of focusing on border enforcement and pausing guest worker programs.

Today *The New York Times* reported on a troubling and harmful long term trend of middle-aged men leaving the workforce:

> "Men have been withdrawing from the labor force for decades. In the years following World War II, more than 97 percent of men in their prime working years --- defined by economists as ages 25 to 54 --- were working or actively looking for work, according to federal data. But starting in the 1960s, that share began to fall, mirroring the decline in domestic manufacturing jobs."

With millions out of labor force, immigration must be tightened.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. Make E-Verify mandatory.
