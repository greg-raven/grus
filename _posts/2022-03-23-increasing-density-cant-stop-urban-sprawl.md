Density alone isn't enough: reduce our immigration-driven population growth.

Twenty-six states with declining development per resident in the 2002-2017 period sprawled over additional large areas of natural habitat and farmland. The population growth in these states simply erased any land-conservation benefit of denser living and better planning. This is why I am writing to you today. Our population growth must be addressed, and it can be done by reducing immigration to a sustainable level. You and your fellow legislators must realize how your policies affect the rest of us, and immigration accounts for 90% of our national population growth. I am deeply concerned about the environmental implications of this population growth, and I urge you to lower the unprecedented rate of immigration.
