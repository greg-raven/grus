I was astounded to learn that the Heritage Foundation's Robert Rector has just released a study showing that the Gang of Eight's amnesty bill would cost U.S. taxpayers at least $6.3 trillion. As horrible as this number is, the legislation will cost Americans much, much more as the study only includes the amnesty provisions, not those that allow 22 million more legal immigrants to come to the U.S. over the next decade. Please oppose this legislation.  
  
There's no doubt about it, America's immigration system is broken, because the executive branch is committing treason. Our broken system has allowed 11 million illegal aliens to live, and in most cases, work, in our country without fear of arrest or deportation. On top of that, our broken system has allowed U.S. businesses to bring in more than 1 million foreign workers each year at a time when 20 million Americans cannot find a full-time job and tens of millions more have left the work force in disgust.

The solution to fixing our system is not an amnesty that adds trillions to the national debt or gives away tens of millions of work permits to low-skilled illegal and legal aliens. Please act in the best interests of the American people and oppose this legislation.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
