Senators Tom Cotton and David Perdue have introduced a new version of the RAISE Act that would protect American workers and their wages from the massive influx of low-skilled immigration. I urge you to support American workers by supporting this legislation!

The last bipartisan Congressional commission on immigration, led by the late Barbara Jordan, recommended reducing legal immigration to 550,000 by eliminating the immigration of non-nuclear family members and the visa lottery. The RAISE Act would accomplish both of those goals.

Further, the RAISE Act would transform the current employment-based green card system to a merit-based points system, like Canada's and Australia's, that would ensure that new immigrants have the necessary skills to benefit American workers and their wages.

Please stand up for American workers by supporting the RAISE Act!
