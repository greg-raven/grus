I was appalled to learn that "comprehensive immigration reform" still has sincere proponents. Don't these people realize that such a plan would devastate millions of Americas?  
  
Not only do supporters of "comprehensive immigration reform" want an amnesty, they also want a massive increase in the number of foreign workers imported each month (currently 125,000 are imported each month). How would this help unemployed Hispanic Americans looking day and night for job opportunities? Clearly, it wouldn't.

I urge you oppose any "comprehensive immigration reform" program because it would have a devastating and everlasting effect on the Hispanic community. Hispanic Americans are unemployed at record numbers and you and your colleagues in Congress need to help them by opposing "comprehensive immigration reform."

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
