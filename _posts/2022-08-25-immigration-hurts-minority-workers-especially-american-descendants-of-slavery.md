I'm deeply concerned that legislators are waging an immigration offensive that will worsen the job prospects for American descendants of slaves, working class Americans, and U.S.-born STEM professionals. Please make helping the American middle-class your primary legislative focus. More immigration means fewer jobs for the American citizens that need them the most.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
