I urge you to support Concealed Carry Reciprocity (S. 1522).

I would like also see amendments that would further strengthen protections in this bill for gun owners in aggressively anti-gun states, localities, and territories.

Currently, gun owners face a confusing patchwork of concealed carry reciprocity, often determined by political state officials who can change the rules on a whim. Unlike other fundamental rights, the right to keep and bear arms is often allowed to be infringed aggressively by state and local authorities.

Thank you for your time and consideration. Please support S. 1522.
