Pass the budget resolution's immigration enforcement funding.

More Americans support President Trump's policy to deport people in the country illegally than any other issue. 58% of all Americans support President Trump's policy to "to find and deport immigrants who are in the U.S. illegally," according to a CBS / YouGov poll. The administration needs funding to continue to enforce the law.

Congress must provide the $175 billion in the budget resolution to keep immigration enforcement going. This is President Trump's top issue and Congress' most important responsibility. The budget resolution vote this week is crucial to provide the needed funding to secure the border and deport illegal aliens.
