It certainly would be a refreshing change if your news writers and presenters took the side of legal U.S. citizens and supported the federal government's eviction of illegal aliens from our country. 

We were hoping that after a couple of days of parroting the radical left-wing talking points, your pandering to illegal aliens, treasonous politicians, and anti-American partisans would abate. 

Apparently not, so we're now asking that you back the Constitution, our laws, and the members of law enforcement who are carrying out these actions. 

Los Angeles is a cesspool of illegal activities, and it must be cleaned up and cleaned out to restore the wonder it had when we were living here as kids.
