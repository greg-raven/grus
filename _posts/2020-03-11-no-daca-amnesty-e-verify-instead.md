Do not support any DACA amnesty!

With the Supreme Court handing down their decision in the Department of Homeland Security v. Regents of the University of California in the coming months, DACA recipients will soon learn their fate. No matter the outcome, Congress cannot amnesty DACA recipients.

Instead, I urge you to mandate the use of the E-Verify system to dissuade future waves of illegal aliens from coming to the U.S. for work and reducing immigration numbers would compensate for the issuance of 700,000 new permanent green cards.

We can only hope that DACA recipients are not allowed to stay in the country and/or gain citizenship, as this would encourage future illegal immigration.

Channel Dianne Feinsteinâ€™s immigration position of 1994 and secure our borders!
