Please oppose the Biden amnesty bill!

Resident Biden's mass amnesty for illegal aliens, the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021, has been introduced by Rep. Linda Sanchez. The Gang of 8's 2013 amnesty legislation was a bad bill, but the Biden amnesty bill is incalculably worse.

The U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021 doesn't even contain a fig leaf of immigration enforcement and expands legal immigration while millions of American workers still struggle as a result of the Covid-19 pandemic.

In addition to its mass amnesty provisions, the bill would expand chain migration, expand the visa lottery, expand employment-based green cards, roll back interior enforcement efforts, and scrap the three and ten year re-entry bans.

The Biden amnesty does nothing for American and legal immigrant workers. Instead, it would actually make it more difficult for unemployed workers to find work with increased foreign worker competition.

I urge you to support American workers by opposing the U.S. Citizenship Act of 2021!

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P. S. We need to secure our borders, stop all immigration for at least ten years, and remove from the country anyone who is in the country illegally.
