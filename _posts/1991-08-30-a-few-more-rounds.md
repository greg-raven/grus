Although I disagree with Jacob Sullum that the Second Amendment is the black sheet of the amendments (I happen to feel that description better fits the Ninth Amendment), I very much enjoyed his article.

As Mr. Sullum pointed, the current rhetoric tends to obscure the fact that the first clash in the Revolutionary War, which took place at Concord on April 19, 1775, came about because the British heard that the Colonials were in possession of *cannon.* The Americans fought back to preserve their right to bear arms.

We can only hope that ultimately the current push for gun control will meet the same fate as the British.
