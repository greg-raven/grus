America spends more than a trillion dollars on programs to help our own unemployed and disadvantaged. So why are we importing millions of immigrants to compete for jobs and resources with them?

Congress should help the unemployed and disadvantaged Americans get decent-paying work, not import millions of new workers to take entry-level jobs. The U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by civil rights activist Barbara Jordan, called for cutting annual legal immigration in half. This would still be double the historical average, and allow for plenty of reasonable immigration. The primary reason for the cutting immigration that the commission cited was that every time immigration levels have been high --- and they are higher in the past decade than every --- wages fell and poverty rose. With so many millions of unemployed Americans and the nation in such a dire fiscal crises, the commission's findings are even more important now than ever.

As Congress considers many "immigration reform" proposals, keep in mind that the reforms we need are those that result in more job openings, less poverty, and lower spending.
