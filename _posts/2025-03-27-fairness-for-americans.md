Cosponsor H.R. 2315 to help American college graduates find jobs.

The OPT program incentivizes the hiring of foreign graduates over American and legal immigrant graduates. Employers don't have to pay FICA or Medicare taxes, making these employees significantly less expensive than American graduates to hire. The OPT program is one of the most widely used guest worker programs even as fewer than 50% of STEM graduates are finding STEM jobs. 

I hope you cosponsor H.R. 2315, the Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act, to end the OPT program.
