Help to end birthright citizenship by cosponsoring H.R. 140.

Australia did it in 2007, New Zealand in 2006, Ireland in 2005, Germany in 1999, France in 1993, and the United Kingdom in 1983. Do you know what all of these nations did in the past 35 years? These nations have passed legislation doing away with birthright citizenship. With Australia's decision to end birthright citizenship in 2007, the United States and Canada are the only remaining industrialized nations to grant citizenship to each and every person born in the country, regardless of his or her parents' nationality or immigration status. Clearly, this ever-shrinking group of nations is not one we want to belong to.

The United States' birthright citizenship law was meant for the children of settlers and those passing through Ellis Island, not for the children of illegal aliens and birth tourists. The times have changed and our laws need to catch up. U.S. citizenship is a privilege and should not benefit those who have broken our laws. Please cosponsor H.R. 140 and help to end this practice.
