I can't tell you how let down I was to read that you are a cosponsor of S. 237. I had expected more of you.

Of the 1.2 million illegal aliens currently working in agriculture, an estimated 860,000 plus their spouses and children could qualify for the AgJOBS amnesty, so the total could reach three million or more.

I am disappointed that, even though the AgJOBS amnesty has failed to gain significant support the past several years, you decided to reintroduce it this year as one your first acts of the 110th Congress. This bill is undoubtedly an amnesty and does not have the support of the American public.

Your support of S. 237 sends the message that you are more concerned about Mexicans than you are about U.S. citizens.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. I know you are smart enough to understand this, so I must assume that you are simply corrupt. Please resign your office immediately, before you commit further treasons.
