Make sure the omnibus spending bill doesn't increase H-2B visas!

I cannot understand why some of your colleagues are pushing for H-2B visa increases in the upcoming omnibus spending bill. American workers are still devastated by the pandemic and the situation will only get worse this winter. Increasing the number of H-2B foreign workers will only make it more difficult for Americans to get back to work.

Increasing H-2B visa numbers will only keep more Americans unemployed and outside the workforce. Because H-2B visa holders tend to take unskilled jobs, these visas harm less-educated and lower-skilled Americans the most. Worse still, these impacted Americans are disproportionately Black and Hispanic Americans.

Further unfairly impacted by the pandemic, Black Americans, Hispanic Americans, and Americans with a high school education or less have been hit the hardest, and increasing H-2B numbers will only escalate the burden. Please ensure the omnibus spending bill doesn't raise the H-2B cap or authorize DHS to raise the cap.
