I am writing to you today to express my opposition to AB-1223, which would impose an unjust financial burden on working-class Californians by placing a tax on firearms and ammunition sales.

AB-1223 would impose a 10% tax on the sale of a handguns and places an 11% tax on all long guns, rifles, firearm precursor parts and ammunition. Just as poll taxes, a method used to prevent minorities from voting, were found unconstitutional, so is an imposition of taxes to prevent people from the exercise of their other fundamental rights --- this includes the right to keep and bear arms.

By placing taxes on guns and ammunition, AB-1223's author, is saying that working-class Californians do not deserve the right to self-defense. For these reasons I urge you to join me in opposing AB-1223.

I *also* oppose AB-1237 and 1509.

AB-1237 mandates that the California Department of Justice (DOJ) supply information, including personal information, to the UC Gun Violence Research Center at UC Davis. This is a gross invasion of privacy for political purposes.

AB-1509 reduces the penalties for criminal misuse of firearms, ironic as the California legislature targets every-day citizens and firearms owners while seeming to favor aggressive criminals.
