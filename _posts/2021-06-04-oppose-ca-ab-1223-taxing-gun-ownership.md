I am writing to you today to express my opposition to A.B. 1223, which would impose an unjust financial burden on working-class Californians by placing a tax on firearms and ammunition sales.

A.B. 1223 would impose a 10% tax on the sale of a handguns and places an 11% tax on all long guns, rifles, firearm precursor parts and ammunition. Just as poll taxes, a method used to prevent minorities from voting, were found unconstitutional, so is an imposition of taxes to prevent people from the exercise of their other fundamental rights --- this includes the right to keep and bear arms.

By placing taxes on guns and ammunition, A.B. 1223's author, is saying that working-class Californians do not deserve the right to self-defense. For these reasons I urge you to join me in opposing A.B. 1223.

I *also* oppose A.B. 1237 and A.B. 1509.

A.B. 1237 mandates that the California Department of Justice (DOJ) supply information, including personal information, to the UC Gun Violence Research Center at UC Davis. This is a gross invasion of privacy for political purposes.

A.B. 1509 reduces the penalties for criminal misuse of firearms, ironic as the California legislature targets every-day citizens and firearms owners while seeming to favor aggressive criminals.
