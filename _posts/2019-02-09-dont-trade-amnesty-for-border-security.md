Please focus on securing the border, not on amnestying illegal aliens!

The continual crises at the southern border prove that it's past time for Congress to secure the border. Congress needs to put politics aside and support legislation to construct additional border fencing, increase the use of technology at the border, and increase the number of Border Patrol agents. Congress has had years to fix this problem but has failed to do so. Additionally, I urge you to oppose efforts to trade amnesty for border security. Giving amnesty to DACA or TPS recipients will only make the problems at the southern border worse by encouraging more people to come to the U.S. illegally. I urge you to help the brave men and women trying to secure our borders to end the border crisis and prevent future ones from occurring.

Please support legislation to construct additional border fencing, increase the use of technology at the border, and increase the number of Border Patrol agents.
