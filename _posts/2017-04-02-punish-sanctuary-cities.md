Our American way of life is threatened by the influx of illegal aliens into the United States. Once here, many of them engage in further criminal activities, including drunk driving, drug use and dealing, robbery, assault, rape, identity theft, kidnapping, sex trafficking, and even murder and terrorism. Regardless of further criminal behavior, their very presence increases the strain on our already-taxed infrastructure, including roads, justice system, water supplies, traffic, and medical facilities, and their children have all but destroyed our education system.

As you know, scores of cities across the United States have declared themselves "sanctuary cities," and, as such, they provide a haven for illegal alien criminals. This constitutes an unconstitutional trampling of Congress' right to determine immigration policy, and it risks the safety of the American people by providing protection to illegal aliens, including terrorists.

Therefore, I demand that the United States Congress immediately pass legislation denouncing the unwise and unsafe concept of "sanctuary cities," and then send that legislation on to President Trump for his signature.

Furthermore, I demand that Congress attach such penalties to the legislation as to make non-compliance exceptionally costly to "sanctuary cities."

Sincerely,
