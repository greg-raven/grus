Before Election Day, voters need to hear before that you will continue to uphold your strong immigration voting record.

I appreciate that you have done a pretty good job of standing up for your constituents and voting in favor of border control and interior enforcement and against proposals to increase the flow of foreign workers. 

Voters need to hear one last pledge from you that you will continue to uphold these values. I think it will be an important factor for many voters as they cast their vote on Tuesday.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
