I am ecstatic that the Trump administration has issued executive orders to help reform and repair our nation's broken immigration system. These executive orders fully or partially deal with 6 of NumbersUSA's "10 Steps to Fix Our Broken Immigration-Enforcement System." In addition to passing legislation to support these executive actions, I urge you and your colleagues to pass legislation to mandate use of the E-Verify system.

American workers were the main victors of the president's executive orders, but it is imperative that Congress take immediate actions to mandate use of the E-Verify system. Mandating E-Verify use would end the jobs magnet that attracts illegal labor to the country, allowing Americans to take these jobs. Additionally, a recent poll conducted by Pulse Opinion Research shows 78% of all American voters support requiring employers to verify the work eligibility of their new hires.

I urge you to follow the president's lead and keep the good news American workers coming.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
