Please cosponsor H.R. 140, the Birthright Citizenship Act.

8 U.S. Code Section 1401 currently says that "a person born in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof shall be nationals and citizens of the United States at birth." The Constitution does not need to be changed to prevent the children of illegal aliens from receiving birthright citizenship; a simple piece of legislation will do.

The United States is almost the only industrialized nation to still practice jus soli --- birthright citizenship. I expect you to help America get with the times by supporting H.R. 140, legislation that would change our nationâ€™s laws and prevent the children of illegal aliens from receiving birthright citizenship. When this is done, illegal aliens will have one less anchor keeping them in this country --- making it less likely that they will remain in the U.S. to take U.S. jobs.
