We are glad you cosponsored the Legal Workforce Act, H.R. 1147. This bill provides for a sensible phase-in of mandatory use of the E-Verify system and will help combat identity fraud. With 18 million Americans unable to find a full-time job and millions more suffering from the ramifications of a stolen identity, this legislation is truly important. Thank you for cosponsoring it.

This legislation, in addition to requiring employers to run new hires through the Chamber of Commerce-approved E-Verify system, would gently move illegal aliens out of U.S. jobs. Over time, the 7 million illegal aliens in non-agricultural jobs would be replaced by unemployed Americans and legal immigrants. While not solving America's unemployment or illegal immigration problems, the Legal Workforce Act would certainly lessen their severity.

I'm very glad you care about putting jobless Americans back to work. Please convince your colleagues to support this bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
