Population growth fueled almost totally by immigration is causing America to lose green spaces, forests, and farm land at a frightening pace. Congress needs to change our nation’s immigration policies before it’s too late.

In the first decade of this century, the 497 Urbanized Areas designated by the U.S. Bureau of Census had to accommodate an extra 26 million, one hundred sixty-eight thousand, five hundred and eighteen residents (most of them citizens from other countries, and their children).

To provide those 26,168,518 new residents with housing, transportation and places to work, to shop and to meet educational, religious, cultural and recreational demands, the 497 Urbanized Areas spread out over an additional 13,586 square miles.

Back in the year 2000, those 13,586 square miles were filled with farmland and the woodland and grassland habitats of myriad animal and plant species. Now, they are filled with urban development.

If we want America to have any green spaces in the decades to come, you need to acknowledge the problem and work to change it. We must lower immigration numbers to pre-1965 levels, remove the illegals and anchor babies already in the country, and secure our borders.
