*The New York Times* recently (8/28/23) reported that America's underground water supplies are being severely depleted. The "mining" of groundwater causes critical problems and is happening across America, especially in arid areas with runaway urban sprawl.

In light of America's widespread mining of nonrenewable resources (e.g., ancient groundwater), we need to slow down population growth. Specifically, illegal immigration now accounts for over 2 million border crossers and visa overstayers per year being released into our nation. Even before this recent surge, the U.S. Census Bureau had projected the U.S. population to exceed 404 million by the Year 2060, with 90% of this growth due to immigration.

There are plenty of ways to humanely reduce immigration rates, e.g., limited chain migration, E-Verify, and better law enforcement to stop the abuses of parole and asylum which lately have been rampant. Your constituents, like me, expect you to safeguard America's groundwater supplies, rather than push growth throughout the country with little regard for future generations.

Sincerely,

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
