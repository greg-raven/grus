The instantaneous hatred, fear, and loathing on the Left for Sarah Palin --- or Palin Derangement Syndrome --- mystifies me. I was talking with a "lifelong" feminist the other day, and she expressed the sentiment that we had to vote for Obama because if McCain became President and died, then Palin would be President. Her tone was one of horror.  
  
I pointed out that for 40+ years, the feminists have been telling us not only that women are as good as men, but that women (although they actually are different, the First Principle notwithstanding) can "have it all," meaning, a family, a career, a life, etc. Now, after 40+ years of not having a female role model for this woman who actually does "have it all," here is Sarah Palin: The feminists should be ecstatic! Clearly, this is not the case.

I think the problem is that the Leftists/feminists are mortified that the first woman to "have it all" is not a Leftist/feminist, and therefore her sin is unforgivable. For these people, ideology trumps all, and neither Palin nor her lifestyle is part of the ideology. Therefore, she is as welcome as a boil.

The hypocrisy is overwhelming.
