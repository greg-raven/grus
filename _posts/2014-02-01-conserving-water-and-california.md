I found on-line your declaration of a state of emergency due to our drought conditions. The declaration reads in part:

"With California facing water shortfalls in the driest year in recorded state history, Governor Edmund G. Brown Jr. today proclaimed a State of Emergency and directed state officials to take all necessary actions to prepare for these drought conditions."

Yet, your own actions belie your commitment to conservation of any kind in California.

In 2011, you signed the second half (A.B. 131) of California's "DREAM Act." This bill gave illegal aliens in-state tuition to California's universities and access to state-funded financial aid.

At the same time, you also signed into law A.B. 1236, essentially banning employers in California from using E-Verify, the national online database used to check workers' immigration status.

Apparently not content with the destructive powers of the other two bills, you then signed a third bill (A.B. 353) to block police from impounding vehicles at checkpoint because a driver is unlicensed. While the bill text does not directly mention illegal aliens, the purpose of the bill is to protect unlicensed individuals, particularly illegal aliens.

At the time you signed these three pieces of legislation, the state unemployment rate was over 12 percent and California was in the midst of a debt crisis.

If you were to obey your oath of office and uphold the law, you would see to it that illegal aliens were removed from the state by any means necessary. This would net us a 10 percent savings in water consumption immediately. Not only that, it would relieve the tremendous burdens illegal aliens place on our infrastructure, legal system, medical establishments, and ecosystem. Just as importantly, it would show that we are governed by laws, not by feelings and emotions, and that if you break the laws, you are punished, not rewarded.

If you are really serious about fixing California, then you must follow and obey the law, and evict the illegal aliens from California. I fear, however, that you like so may others are merely a demagogue, and have no intention of fixing anything.
