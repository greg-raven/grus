We expect you to ensure that the E-Verify provisions of the DHS Appropriations bill survive the Conference Committee!  
  
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the current U-6 unemployment rate is 15.9%. This means that 25 million Americans are considered to be unemployed. Doesn’t this fact break your heart? While it may sadden you, it surely doesn’t sadden Majority Leader Reid or Speaker Pelosi.

The February stimulus bill passed by the House of Representatives had language that reauthorized the E-Verify program for five years. This sent a strong message to unscrupulous employers that the hiring of illegal workers would not be tolerated. Unfortunately, Reid and Pelosi stripped this language in the Conference Committee. Their actions reinforced the misconception that hiring illegal workers is acceptable.

It is very likely that Obama, Reid, and Pelosi will try to do the same thing to the DHS Appropriations bill. I am counting on you to ensure that they are not able to harm American workers a second time by removing the E-Verify provisions from the DHS Appropriations bill in the Conference Committee.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
