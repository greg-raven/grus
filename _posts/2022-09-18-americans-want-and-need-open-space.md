Despite, and perhaps because of, the growing population density of our nation, Americans more than ever feel strongly about the need to protect open spaces. These natural areas support agricultural and forest production, and provide clean water, flood control, wildlife habitat and biodiversity, and recreational opportunities.

But the demands of our rapid population growth are outstripping the supply of America's open spaces. This relentless growth has been primarily a result of Congress' unwillingness to address our immigration policies. The Census Bureau projects the U.S. population will add 75 million people by the Year 2060, with roughly 90 percent of that growth resulting from immigration.

Please support efforts that would reduce our burgeoning population growth, namely legislation that would create a humane immigration system that respects the dignity of every person while conserving our nation's open space by allowing for America's population to stabilize.
