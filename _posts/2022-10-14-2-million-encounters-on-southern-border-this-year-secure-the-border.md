The Biden-Harris "root cause" migration plan has failed, as is documented in The Washington Post column "U.S. arrests along Mexico border top 2 million a year for first time" that was published this month.

People can simply make far more money in the United States than in their home countries. They look at the 2 million who have been released into the country and think "why not me?"

It’s not crazy to be concerned about the border.

The record border surge has undermined Biden’s goals for equity and conservation, and produced spikes in homelessness, a "glam migration" industry with an extensive Uber network, new national security risks and child labor exploitation.

Please work with your colleagues to implement sensible border controls, including:

- Raise the credible fear standard, so that migrants can no longer claim evidenceless fears to gain perfunctory release into the United States.
- End parole abuse (Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is releasing people en masse, with work permits, when parole is supposed to be a case-by-case basis).
- Mandate the Migration Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") to end the incentive of falsely claiming asylum in order to be released into the U.S.
- Require the Department of Homeland Security to reject asylum claims from migrants who have already passed through a safe country on their way to the United States.

Sincerely,
