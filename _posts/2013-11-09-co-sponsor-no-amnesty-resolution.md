It is disappointing that some in Congress still want to give illegal aliens an amnesty, despite the current economic jobs climate. Please cosponsor H. Res. 326, a resolution that calls on Congress to reject any immigration reform that provides illegal aliens with legal status or amnesty.

With 20 million Americans unable to find a full-time job, it's important that illegal aliens not be given work permits, legal status, or amnesty as part of any immigration reform legislation. I hope you will cosponsor H.Res. 326 and make it clear that amnesty is not the sort of immigration reform America needs.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
