I urge you to oppose any expansion of the H-2B low-skilled guest worker program in the upcoming continuing resolution. The unemployment rates for Americans with a high school degree or less are nearly double the national average, and these Americans have to compete directly for jobs with H-2B visa holders.

Pres. Obama is demanding that Congress fund the resettlement of 110,000 refugees in FY2017 despite warnings from FBI Director James Comey that refugees from terrorist-sponsoring nations cannot be fully vetted. Please include a moratorium on refugee resettlement from terrorist-sponsoring nations in the upcoming continuing resolution until an assessment of the national security risks they present can be completed.
