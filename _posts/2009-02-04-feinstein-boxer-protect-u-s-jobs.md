A new report released by the Heritage Foundation says that 300,00 construction jobs created by the economic stimulus package will go to illegal workers. This does not serve country's interests!

It is absurd that the Senate would even consider passing an economic stimulus package that does not protect the rights of American workers. Those 300,000 lost construction jobs are just the tip of the iceberg as construction projects account for less than 12% of the stimulus package.

I urge you to ensure that sufficient protections for American workers are present in the economic stimulus package. You can do this by supporting efforts to mandate the use of E-Verify for recipients of stimulus funds.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
