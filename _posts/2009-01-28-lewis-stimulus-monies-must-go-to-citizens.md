The amendments offered to the stimulus package by Rep. Calvert and Rep. Kingston will help protect American jobs. Thank you for supporting their efforts.

There are more than 11 million unemployed Americans and I feel it is necessary for the federal government to make sure any jobs created by the economic stimulus package go to unemployed Americans and not illegal aliens.

I am glad you share my views. I'm very thankful for your support of the amendments offered by Rep. Ken Calvert and Rep. Jack Kingston relating to employment verification. Please do all you can to make sure these provisions are retained in the final version of the stimulus package.

Millions of unemployed Americans are depending on their government to stimulate and protect jobs. These two amendments which you supported will go a long way to protect stimulus money for Americans.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Mr. Greg Raven
