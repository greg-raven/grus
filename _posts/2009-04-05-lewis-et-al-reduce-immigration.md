There are more than 13 million out-of-work Americans and the number is growing by the day. Something must be done!

I find it truly appalling that American businesses are allowed to import 138,000 foreign workers each month when more than 13.2 million Americans are unemployed and are unable to find a job. Why does the Congress feel that it is so important for foreign workers to have a steady supply of jobs when tens of thousands of Americans are losing their jobs each day? Doesn't this seem incredibly unjust to you?

I urge you to right this tremendous wrong by working to reform America's ineffective and wasteful immigration system. Please work to halt most forms of immigration so that unemployed Americans have a decent chance of finding a job.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. If you don't stop this insanity, we will soon cease to exist as a country.
