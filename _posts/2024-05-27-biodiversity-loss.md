I am concerned about America's persistent biodiversity loss, which is a direct result of population growth. Despite all our technological advances, we are completely dependent on healthy ecosystems for our water, food, medicines, clothes, fuel, shelter, energy, and more.

During the past 20 years, we've paved over more than 11.5 million acres. Most of the loss was a result of our nation's population growing by nearly 40 million people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our country is poised to add another 70 million people by 2060 --- with roughly 90% due to immigration.

Lower immigration rates will save what's left of America's biodiversity.

I am urging you to support the Secure the Border Act (H.R. 2) and the Nuclear Family Priority Act (H.R. 7833) so that America can regain control over our nation's unprecedented levels of immigration. Our future, and biodiversity, depend on it.
