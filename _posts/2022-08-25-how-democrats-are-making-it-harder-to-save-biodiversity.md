I am writing to you because I am concerned about our unsustainable population growth, driven primarily by your immigration policies, which add more than one million per year (more than two million since the current border crisis began). America is inexorably losing its open spaces and wilderness areas, along with a wide array of wildlife.

The iconic monarch butterfly serves as a tragic example, as a group of scientists have put it back on the endangered list. Over the past 30 years the monarch butterfly population has declined by more than 99% due primarily to habitat loss. During that same period, human population within the monarch’s range had grown by 50%, an additional 22 million people. What followed was the butterflies’ historical habitat being cleared for housing, lawns, roads, and farmland.

The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that, at today’s growth rate, America’s population will reach 404 million in 40 years, and more than 90% of this increase will be from immigration. So as to reduce population pressures on our wildlife and wilderness, please take pass immigration legislation that would lower America’s rapid population growth.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
