Please do not support Rep. McCaul's efforts to include his border legislation, H.R.1417, as part of the solution to end the border surge. The bill would weaken current law and give the Senate an opportunity to attach the Gang of Eight's amnesty to the deal.

While Rep. McCaul thinks his legislation would help fix the border surge, it would actually make the overall problem worse. His bill, H.R.1417, weakens existing law by requiring DHS to focus solely on high-traffic areas and the Southern border instead of all land and maritime borders, weakens the definition of "operational control", and could potentially gut the Congressionally-mandated biometric entry/exit system.

Instead, Pres. Obama must be forced to begin immediately deporting people who cross our borders illegally. Until he proves that he's willing to enforce the actual laws on the books, he shouldn't be given a single dime, and most of all, the House shouldn't be weakening existing laws.

Please do not support any effort by Rep. McCaul to include his border bill to the House's response to the ongoing border surge. Instead, hold Pres. Obama accountable and work towards a solution that will tell the countries of the world that illegal immigration to the United States will no longer be tolerated.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
