My wife and I are utterly and unalterably opposed to any move to impeach President Trump. He's our president, and he's doing a great job. Just imagine how much greater our country could be if you would pitch in? I recommend starting with mandating E-Verify, securing our borders, and ratifying the USMCA.

Contact me if you want to discuss this.
