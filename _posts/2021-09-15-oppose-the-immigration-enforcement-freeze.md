In addition to amnestying millions of illegal aliens and drastically increasing legal immigration levels, the Democrats' budget reconciliation amnesty will halt virtually all ICE interior enforcement for at least one year. Any alien in removal proceedings or subject to removal or voluntary departure orders will be allowed to apply for amnesty or will be assumed to qualify for an amnesty. This means that ICE must assume that nearly every illegal alien qualifies for the amnesty and the agency will be unable to apprehend illegal aliens and keep our nation safe.

Preventing ICE from enforcing the law sets a dangerous precedent and will encourage millions of additional economic migrants to come to the U.S. illegally.

Please do all you can to stop the Democrats' outrageous and dangerous budget reconciliation amnesty and enforcement freeze!
