I am writing to you today to inform you that I stand in strong opposition to your bill --- H.R. 125.

This legislation is unconstitutional, vague, and actually makes no sense even considering how federal law is written today. It would unfairly impose an even greater burden on lawful gun owners who may need firearms and ammunition to protect their families during this national time of crisis.

I cannot in good conscience allow this draconian legislation to advance in the Congress. Therefore, I respectfully urge you to withdraw your bill from consideration.
