Border Patrol agents are on pace to make more than 2 million apprehensions of illegal border crossers during the current fiscal year. It's time for Congress to take action to end this historic border crisis!

I urge you to immediately pass legislation that would:

1. Mandate the successful Remain in Mexico policy that requires asylum seekers to remain in Mexico until their asylum hearing.

2. End asylum shopping by preventing illegal border crossers from applying for asylum when they've travelled through a safe third country en route to the U.S. I urge you to immediately work with your colleagues to pass these reforms through Congress!

3. Strengthen border security by building more border barriers.

These three actions aren't the only ones needed to stop future surges, but all three will go a long way in ending the current border surge and preventing future ones.
