I urge you to *reject* H.R. 1207 --- the federal ban on online ammo sales.

This draconian legislation would criminalize law-abiding gun owners attempting to purchase ammo online. Indeed, in the midst of a nationwide shortage of firearms and ammunition, anti-gun members of Congress are seeking to further strangulate the supply of ammo with this bill.

H.R. 1207 would further require that gun dealers report bulk purchases of ammo --- a common transaction --- to law enforcement. This chilling requirement would effectively allow the government to treat everyday gun owners with suspicion.

This legislation is an infringement on the People's fundamental right to keep and bear arms, and I therefore must urge you to vote NO on H.R. 1207.
