Water is dwindling, but the population is growing.

Unsustainable population growth has finally come head to head with mother nature. The federal government has declared (for the first time) a water shortage due to the overallocation of the Colorado River. States relying on the river have seen rapid demand-driven development with no end in sight. While technology may act as a band-aid, relying on this alone is unrealistic. In the long run, you have to address demand.

In this country, 90% of our population growth is due to immigration. Federal immigration policies will add another 79 million to our population between the years 2016 and 2060. I am saying nothing negative about immigrants as people, who play an important role in our country, but the hard truth is that too many people relying on a limited water source is a recipe for disaster. Please use common sense and bring immigration down to a sustainable level.

P.S. Secure our borders now, evict from the country anyone who does not belong here, and institute a 20-year moratorium on all new immigration including refugees.
