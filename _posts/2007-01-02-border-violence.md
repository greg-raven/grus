Here is yet more proof that we must secure our borders, and expel those who have already illegally entered our country. Furthermore, we must fight any and every effort to merge the U.S. and Mexico, which includes the NAFTA superhighway project.

NUEVO LAREDO, Mexico --- The gunfire was deafening. Street corners all over the city were darkened by smoke from grenades and light artillery.

The dead lay in pools of blood flowing into the gutters that drain into the Rio Grande.

Men with automatic assault rifles stood stoic after the carnage. Then, one by one, they picked up the bodies of their victims, threw them into the back of pickup trucks and headed out of downtown.

Bystanders hid inside shops, behind trash bins --- wherever they could find refuge from the explosive showdown between members of rival drug cartels.

"(I watched as) the men threw the bodies into the back of the trucks and SUVs," whispered Manuel, who was working at a parking garage that day. "This city is controlled from the inside out by the cartels.... They are killing anyone who gets in their way."

The April street violence, witnessed by several residents interviewed by the Daily Bulletin, was but one recent example of how Mexico's cartels are fighting each other over the four major U.S. highway systems that provide transit routes into the United States.

Street violence has become a way of life for the nearly 380,000 residents of Mexico's most violent border city. According to law enforcement officials in Mexico and U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration officials, more than 500 people were assassinated in Nuevo Laredo in 2005. Official estimates, in news reports, put the 2005 death toll at 186.

This year, assassinations have topped nearly 500, and the death toll continues to rise. Many of the dead either belonged to the cartels or were innocent victims of the carnage.

The violence has also changed the lives of American citizens living in Laredo, on the Texas side of the border, where kidnappings, narcotics trafficking and corruption have become more common.

Laredo Police Officer James Boyd, who used to travel to Nuevo Laredo on archaeological digs, is now terrified to enter the city.

This year on a trip into Nuevo Laredo, he said he was chased by four SUVs and his car shot at several times by cartel members.

"People should know that the border has been taken hostage by the cartels," Boyd said. "So many officials try to cover up what's going on. Why? I guess they don't want the public to know the truth."

The truth is tied up in trucks, trade and transcontinental smuggling.

The World Trade Bridge between Nuevo Laredo and its sister city, Laredo, as well as Interstate 35 and highways 59, 359 and 83, are like veins feeding the Mexican syndicates, running from south Texas to as far north as Canada.

For Mexico's most powerful drug lords, controlling the routes and protecting the cargo sent along them --- drugs, weapons and people --- is worth the cost in lives.

It's also reason to focus U.S. border patrol efforts sharply on Nuevo Laredo, say law enforcement officials, since the city is the largest inland port from Mexico into the United States and is a major point of origin for truck traffic into the U.S.

"Those who control Nuevo Laredo control the U.S. highways and the flow of narcotics into the United States," said Sheriff Rick Flores, whose Webb County territory runs along the Texas-Mexico border.

"This city is an open gateway for narcotics and terrorists," Flores said. "If the price is right, anyone --- and I mean anyone --- can move weapons of mass destruction, people and drugs into the United States."

Not one local Mexican or U.S. newspaper reported the April street violence. Reporters don't go into Nuevo Laredo's streets often, and when they do, they don't report on the cartels.

Not one Nuevo Laredo municipal police officer ever appeared at the scene, either.

It was as if the bloodbath never happened.

### CARTEL CULTURE

Comandante Enrique Sanchez of the Nuevo Laredo Police Department said he couldn't recall the April shootings, though he compared the violence in Nuevo Laredo to that in Iraq.

His department has been plagued by trouble. President Vicente Fox's administration has described the city's police as corrupt, and residents interviewed by the Daily Bulletin said many police officers work for the Gulf Cartel, one of Mexico's most powerful narcotics-trafficking organizations.

"You never know when the bullets are going to come flying," Sanchez said during a recent tour of the city by pickup. His men, officers Roberto Zepeda, 23, and Jose Santos, 28, stood in the bed of the police vehicle, AR-15 rifles pointed toward the streets. "You never know when you're going to die."

The dead are often forgotten. The cartels dispose of bodies on the outskirts of the city in vats of acid, mutilate them in factory machines, feed them to animals or set them ablaze in gas containers until all evidence of their existence is gone.

Not one of the city's nearly 400 official murders since January 2005 has been solved.

"The attention that the assassinations have brought to the cartels has caused them to change their tactics," said Nacho, a resident who sometimes assists U.S. law enforcement with information. "The bodies are destroyed before people even realize someone's missing."

Although Colombian cartels control most of the world's production of cocaine and heroin, the most profitable part of the trade --- transport to the U.S. --- happens in Mexico, said Jorge Chabat, a drug expert at the Center for Economic Research and Teaching in Mexico City.

Distribution of narcotics has come under the control of various Mexican cartels, Chabat said, including Osiel C rdenas' Gulf Cartel; Joaquin "El Chapo" Guzman's Sinaloa Cartel; Francisco Javier Arellano Felix's organization in Tijuana; and the Juarez Cartel, said to be led by Vicente Carrillo.

A woman who asked to be called only Lupita for her own protection, and who grew up with family members of several of the city's original narcotics organizations, remembers them all.

Lupita, who works with law enforcement, also remembers a time when Nuevo Laredo was at peace, and recalled the moment everything changed.

More than 10 years ago, the city was mainly controlled by two narcotics organizations, Flores Soto and Los Chachos, Lupita said. Mario Flores Soto, the leader of Flores Soto, joined forces with the Gulf Cartel to expand his revenue and power. The Gulf Cartel wanted control of Laredo's highway systems. Flores Soto shared the city's transit routes with the cartel, pulling narcotics revenue away from Dionicio "El Chacho" Ramon Garcia, the leader of Los Chachos.

Los Chachos members were enraged, Lupita said, and kidnapped and killed Mario Flores Soto's youngest brother, Roy, and 10 of his associates.

In retaliation for the kidnappings and murders, the Gulf Cartel's paramilitary arm, Los Zetas --- a group of more than 30 special operations soldiers, deserters from the Mexican military --- assassinated many of the key members of Los Chachos. It wasn't long before the surviving members of the Chachos wanted revenge, Lupita said.

"They took Dionicio, the leader, murdered him and left him in women's underwear for everyone to see," she said.

El Chacho, who was assassinated in May 2002, was on his way back from Monterrey, a city reportedly under the control of the Sinaloa Cartel, another of Mexico's most powerful narcotics organizations.

"The violence kept growing, and the methods for killing just keep getting worse," Lupita said.

Osiel Cardenas, the leader of the Gulf Cartel, was arrested on March 14, 2003, in Matamoros, Mexico. Since then, Los Zetas have been running the organization, according to sources interviewed by the Daily Bulletin.

The Sinaloa Cartel is attempting to take control of the Gulf Cartel away from Los Zetas, and is said to have the backing of many politicians and federal law enforcement officials within Mexico.

"The reason the government never intervened (to stop the violence) is because many of the government officials from Mexico City to Nuevo Laredo are in the pocket of the cartels," Lupita said.

"Once the killing began, it never stopped. The hatred between the narcos grew stronger and stronger."

### 'THIS USED TO BE A GOOD PLACE'

Nacho has lived in Nuevo Laredo most of his adult life. He is a father, husband and one of the few people willing to share the dark secrets of his city.

Although he has family in the United States, he refuses to cross the border illegally to escape the danger.

"I have applied for a visa," he said. "My family already lives in fear. We don't want to escape to live illegally as fugitives.

"People need to know the truth (about Nuevo Laredo)," he continued. "This used to be a good place. Now it is a danger to anyone who enters."

Nacho parked his car near a town square. It was once a lover's walkway where he courted his wife. Now, only a handful of people frequent its winding sidewalks or sit on its iron benches.

"I remember it being so crowded with people, and the fresh fruit, taquitos and ice cream vendors," Nacho recalled.

When the violence in Nuevo Laredo reached a peak in June, the Fox administration began Operation Secure Mexico, sending in Mexican military and other federal law enforcement agencies.

"There are very clear signs of a relationship between elements of the Nuevo Laredo police and drug smuggling, hence the decisive action," government spokesman Ruben Aguilar told journalists in June.

But by the end of July, the streets were empty of military.

Comandante Sanchez chuckled when asked what happened to the Mexican military who were supposed to be protecting the city.

"That's a good question," he said, a sardonic smile creasing his face. "Where are they?"

Sanchez explained that most of the troops were as afraid for their lives as Nuevo Laredo's police and citizens. Some simply left and didn't return. Others, already in the pockets of the cartels, made an early show of enforcement, then disappeared.

Nacho said the Mexican government sent the military to appease the U.S. government, "then pulled them out of the city just as fast."

While he was speaking, a man in shabby clothes stood in the middle of the street, watching Nacho's car. A Nextel phone hung from the man's waistband.

"All over the city, there are halcones or ventanas (falcons or windows)," Nacho said. "They are the eyes and the ears of the cartels."

The man directed Nacho's car into an empty parking space.

"Never forget to tip," Nacho said as he handed a peseta to the man. "Never forget that everybody, no matter how nice they are or what they look like, could be working for the cartels.

"O plata o plomo."

### 'NOTHING HAS CHANGED'

"Silver or lead," said the middle-aged, white-haired man as he sipped a martini at a hotel bar in Laredo. "That's the code in Mexico. Either you pay up or you're killed."

James Kuykendall Sr., a former special agent with U.S Drug Enforcement Administration who now runs his own business in the city, knows Mexico well.

His friend and DEA partner, Enrique "Kiki" Camarena, was kidnapped, tortured and murdered by the drug cartels in 1985 while working undercover in Guadalajara. His death brought national attention to the Mexican drug war and the corruption that plagued the Mexican government.

Kuykendall's book, "O Plata O Plomo," published last year, focused on the events surrounding Camarena's death and how the Mexican government failed to cooperate with the DEA in the investigation.

"Nothing has changed in Mexico. If anything, it's worse," Kuykendall said.

"Kiki died a hero. He gave his life for his country. The tragedy is that the U.S. government gave up on the war on drugs decades ago. They choose to ignore the corruption that is deeply embedded in the Mexican government."

The arrests of some of Mexico's most notorious drug traffickers --- the recent capture of reputed drug kingpin Francisco Javier Arellano Felix being one example --- are just the tip of the iceberg when it comes to cooperation, Kuykendall added.

"Every once in awhile, Mexico throws us a bone," he said. "It gives the appearance of cooperation. It's a way of making everything look like it's OK. Well, it's not."

### BAZOOKAS, BULLETS

Nacho ran his palm over a wall in a home that had been blasted by a bazooka. Bullet holes riddled the interior of the house.

The cartels don't just use guns, he said. They have grenades, bombs and a variety of other weapons.

"This house was rented by a group of asesinos (assassins) with the Sinaloa Cartel," Nacho said. The assassins were sent to the city to kill members of Los Zetas, he added.

Old mattresses, cigarette boxes and empty beer bottles were the gunmen's only remnants. A brick fence running alongside the house had been blown apart with such force that the bricks were nothing but crumbled dust.

"Sometimes I just can't believe what's happened to this city," Nacho said.

Around the corner from the home, Our Lady of Guadalupe, Mexico's patron saint, loomed over the neighborhood. Fresh flowers and candles stood at the base of a portrait painted on the brick wall.

"She will bring us peace," said a young girl, smiling as she walked past Nacho.

Just a few yards away, a group of young men with Nextel phones made it clear Nacho was in the wrong part of town. They only had to look at him.

"We better go," he said. "It's not good to stand around here for too long. There are many good people in this city, but you never know."

### 'WE ARE PRISONERS'

Hector cut some cilantro and dropped it into a small bowl. He is the only vendor left at a small placita near the center of town, and his 10-year-old business is barely surviving the violence.

"I remember when I couldn't keep up with the tourists," he said as he put freshly cooked carnitas into a tortilla. The smell of cilantro, onions and pork filled the air.

"I used to have a lot of competition. Now I'm the only one left at the square, and I make less than half of what I used to make."

Nuevo Laredo once was noted for its tourism, colorful street vendors and booming border economy. But the drug violence has made this city of 400,000 a wasteland of lost businesses and lost lives.

More than 100 businesses have moved from Nuevo Laredo to Laredo over the past three years. And while its Texas sister is reaping the rewards of the World Trade Bridge and a growing economy, Nuevo Laredo residents are struggling to make ends meet.

Roll-down security shutters cover the large display windows of shops in the artisan district near the border. Dental offices and pharmacies that once thrived off American consumers have closed because the violence is keeping those customers away. For Sale and For Rent signs posted on the closed doors are pointed reminders of what the city has become.

"In Laredo, life is different," Hector said. "Here we are prisoners. In our city, we learn to live with the devil."
