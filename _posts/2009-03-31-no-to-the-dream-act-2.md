You have shown a tendency of preferring illegal alien workers over unemployed Americans. Please change this tendency and oppose the anti-American worker DREAM Act amnesty.

There are more than 12 million unemployed Americans. Supporting the DREAM Act amnesty would be an affront to these American men and women. How would a mass amnesty help Americans who cannot put food on their tables or pay their mortgages?

The DREAM Act, in addition to harming unemployed Americans, would harm everyone living in the United States. This bill does not protect the United States from terrorists and criminals. Illegal aliens are not required to submit fingerprints or undergo background security checks at any point in the DREAM Act process. Therefore, DHS has no way of knowing whether or not an alien seeking DREAM Act amnesty is a terrorist or criminal.

This security failure is compounded by the confidentiality section of the DREAM Act, which is a relic from pre-9/11 days (itâ€™s modeled on the fraud-prone 1986 amnesty). This section basically requires DHS to hide information about terrorist and criminal aliens from itself. If a DHS adjudicator at USCIS learns from a DREAM Act application that an alien poses terrorist or criminal concerns, the adjudicator is PROHIBITED from alerting ICE enforcement officers at DHS, and in fact, if the adjudicator did volunteer such information to ICE, he could be fined $10,000.

To cap it all, DHS is PROHIBITED from removing from the United States all aliens, including criminals, terrorists, fraudsters, and other ineligible aliens while they have a DREAM Act application pending, even if that application is based upon fraud or the alien is ineligible.

In addition to being a nightmare for unemployed Americans, the DREAM Act would seriously endanger the security of our nation and everyone within our borders.

I urge you to break your habit of supporting illegal alien workers over unemployed Americans by opposing the nightmarish DREAM Act. Please remember that I, and many other of your constituents, will be watching your actions very closely.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
