Constitutional rights do not end at state borders. That is why Senator Cornyn introduced S. 446 --- Constitutional Concealed Carry Reciprocity Act of 2017 --- that stops anti-gun states such as New York and California from cancelling the Second Amendment rights of Americans.

I urge you to cosponsor S. 446 and support it with your Yes vote.
