I am writing to you today to alert you to legislation which would severely infringe on the rights of law-abiding gun owners. As a supporter of the Firearms Policy Coalition (FPC), I strongly oppose these bills.

H.R. 1446, H.R. 8, and S. 529 would result in the implementation of so-called "Universal Background Checks." But we all know what that really means: a nationwide gun registry.

A gun registry has long been the goal of anti-gun politicians because they know it is a necessary step toward full-on gun confiscation.

As criminals do not submit to background checks, all this proposed legislation would do is hand the government more power and a mandate to abuse the taxpayers.

That's why I respectfully urge you to vote NO on any attempt to pass H.R. 8, H.R. 1446 or S. 529.
