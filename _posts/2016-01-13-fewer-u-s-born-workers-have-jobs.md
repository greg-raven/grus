Newly-released data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics shows that U.S.-born workers lost 320,000 jobs while 306,000 foreign-born workers gained jobs. This is unacceptable and is another example why immigration to the U.S. needs to be reduced. I hope you will help American workers by reducing immigration numbers. Every month, U.S.-born workers are squeezed out of the workplace. The most recent jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics only reinforces this trend. The U.S. currently brings in more than 125,000 new foreign workers each month — that’s more than 1.5 million each year. How can U.S.-born workers hope to compete when many of the newly-created jobs go to foreign-born workers? American workers are struggling and they need Congress’ help. I hope you will help all U.S.-born workers by taking steps to reduce immigration numbers.
