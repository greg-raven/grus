Caliph Hussein, a man who from outward appearances has never experienced a single moment of reason or reasonableness in his entire life, now says he knows how much a reasonable retirement savings account should hold, so that any amount over that is unreasonable and therefore taxable.

"Under current rules, some wealthy individuals are able to accumulate many millions of dollars in these accounts, substantially more than is needed to fund reasonable levels of retirement saving," the White House told Politico last week.

Keep in mind that Caliph Hussein himself stands to live high on the hog for the rest of his days thanks to the taxpayers, surrounded by armed guards from the Secret Service, despite having millions in assets himself. Perhaps he needs this additional tax revenue to keep Michelle Antoinette in lobster and silk, not to mention vacations and travel.
