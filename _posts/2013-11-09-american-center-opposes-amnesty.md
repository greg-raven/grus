It’s disappointing that President Obama wants to force an amnesty for illegal aliens through Congress, even though a new NBC News poll shows that a majority of the American people --- the so-called American center --- opposes this. I hope you will take the results of this poll to heart and share it with your colleagues.  
  
According to the poll, the "American Center" consists of four distinct groups: Minivan Moderates, the MBA Middle, Pick-up Populists, and WhateverMan. This group, when taken together, comprise more than 50% of the American population.

When these group was asked if they supported providing illegal aliens with a pathway to citizenship, only 12% of this group "strongly support" giving illegal aliens a "path to citizenship" while 38% strongly oppose this. Overall, 54% of the center oppose giving illegal aliens a path to citizenship while only 32% support it.

It’s clear that the American people, particularly the moderate center, do not support giving illegal aliens any special benefits. Please take this poll to heart and spread its results amongst your colleagues.
