As Rep. John Dingell (D-MI) rightly pointed out recently, "cap and trade is a tax, and it's a great big one." Estimates are that this national energy tax would cost the average American family $3,900 per year!  
  
I am writing to ask you to vote NO on any cap and trade bill that comes up for a vote this congressional session. Cap and trade is a huge tax on every American who flips on a light switch or puts gas in their car. Cap and trade would do nothing to affect global climate change, but would harm our economy and lead to job losses and higher taxes for all Americans.

Please vote no on cap and tax.

Sincerely,
