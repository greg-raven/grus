Support the American middle class by moderating immigration levels.

I hope you work with your colleagues to reduce immigration levels to restore our middle class.

In the mid-20th century (between 1940-1980):

- Real incomes of white males grew by two-and-a-half-fold;

- Real incomes for Black men expanded by four-fold; and

- The Black middle class grew from 22 percent to 71 percent.

These positive economic trends stalled in the 1970s after Congress restarted mass immigration.

The late Congresswoman Barbara Jordan, the first Southern Black woman elected to the United States House of Representatives, chaired the U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform under President Bill Clinton and advocated for sensible immigration limit recommendations including;

- Reforming the family-based preference categories to focus solely on spouses and minor children of new immigrants;

- Eliminating the Adult Siblings and Adult Children categories; and

- Creating a 5-year renewable nonimmigrant visa for parents of new immigrants.

Please contact me to discuss how supporting these measures and sending H.R. 7833, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, to Resident Biden's desk, will restore our middle class.
