It is disappointing that pro-illegal alien protestors are on the National Mall demanding an amnesty for lawbreakers. I urge you to rebuff their demands and help put jobless Americans into construction and service jobs held by millions of illegal aliens.

Every low-skilled immigrant household costs U.S. taxpayers nearly $20,000 each year. All told, this costs U.S. taxpayers nearly $90 billion each year (or $330 per American). As bad as this sounds, an amnesty for illegal aliens would make matters much, much worse. An amnesty for the 11-18 million illegal aliens living in the United States would cost U.S. taxpayers $2.5 trillion.

It's bad enough that 663,000 taxpayers left the labor force in March, now some Senators want to force the remaining taxpayers to foot the bill for a gigantic amnesty that would prevent the 22 million Americans without a full-time job from finding one.

Please say no to amnesty and comprehensive immigration reform.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Instead of amnesty for criminals, how about evicting all illegals and securing our borders? It's a pretty sorry day for the nation when I have to recommend to my senators to follow the law!
