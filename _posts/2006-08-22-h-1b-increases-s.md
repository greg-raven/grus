I am counting on you to oppose Sen. Cornyn's SKIL Act and the related H-1B increases included in S. 2611.

Here are just a few reasons why I hope you will oppose the SKIL Act:

1. The six-year visas allow foreign workers to bring in their families, and guarantee thousands of anchor babies.

2. H-1B salaries are tax-exempt --- no FICA, no federal or state income taxes. They can live at the same level as tax-paying Americans at a lower cost. Therefore, Congress allows foreigners to "low-ball" American workers.

3. H-1Bs can leave the job they came to fill and seek other jobs, not necessarily in the "hard to fill" category.

4. Most H-1Bs are of a "protected" ethnic group, so H-1Bs have an affirmative action preference when competing with Americans for the same jobs.

The result of the SKIL Act would be to further depress the wages of Americans working in high-tech and scientific fields and to cause additional job displacement for those workers.

Please oppose S. 2691.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Please don't support this move to make Americans second-class citizens in our own country!
