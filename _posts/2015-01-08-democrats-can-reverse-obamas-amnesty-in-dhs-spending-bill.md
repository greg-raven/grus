President Obama's executive actions on immigration goes against the will and the best interests of the American people. I urge you to defund all of the administration's immigration actions in the upcoming DHS Appropriations bill.

The Obama Administration's executive actions on immigration present economic problems for American workers and their families. Currently there are 18 million Americans who want a full-time job, but cannot find one. Additionally, according to the Census Bureau, one in five young adults, ages 18 to 34 years old, live in poverty due to "lower rates of employment." A study by Investors Business Daily/TIPP found that 63% of all Americans oppose work permits for illegal aliens, thereby not allowing them to compete with American workers for jobs.

Adding millions of more workers also will continue to stagnate wages. According to federal data, middle-class wages, when adjusted for inflation, are lower now than in 1979. Additionally, according to a Wall Street Journal study, the wages of those in one-third of all U.S. counties have declined since 2004.

I urge you to defund all of the administration's immigration actions in the upcoming DHS Appropriations bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
