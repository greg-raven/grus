I am strongly opposed to S.B. 1384, which requires licensed firearms dealers to have a digital video surveillance system, burglary alarm system, and a keyless entry system on their premises.

This bill is a huge violation of privacy rights. It requires the camera to capture images around the clock and will thus record *all* sales, whether firearms or ammunition related. What precautions must be taken to make certain the videos cannot be made public? And, the recording of personal conversations of customers while shopping in the store is not only frightening, but it is a gross intrusion of personal privacy.

Since people who commit heinous acts of violence with guns don't patronize gun stores or get their firearms from licensed dealers, this bill will only harm the gun businesses and the law-abiding. I stand with Gun Owners of California and believe this bill violates two of our enumerated constitutional rights --- the 2nd Amendment and the 4th.
