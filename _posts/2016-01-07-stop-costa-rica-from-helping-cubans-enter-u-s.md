We're disappointed that Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Mexico have struck a deal to send thousands of Cubans who are stranded in Costa Rica to Mexico, via El Salvador. This deal will only encourage more Cubans to try to enter the U.S. illegally and needs to be opposed. he just-passed omnibus spending bill allows aid dollars for El Salvador to be reduced if the country is not certified by the Secretary of State as doing enough to combat illegal immigration. We believe this deal should prevent their certification and we hope you will convey this message to the State Department.

I cannot understand why encouraging illegal immigration is considered an appropriate response to illegal aliens being stuck in your country. Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Mexico's actions are disappointing and cannot go without response. The United States has reestablished diplomatic relations with Cuba and recent exposes have shown that the majority of Cuban immigrants to the United States are no longer afraid to return to Cuba.

Secretary of State John Kerry must refuse to certify El Salvador as taking steps to stop illegal immigration. Withholding U.S. aid dollars will send the message that harboring illegal aliens and promoting their entry into the United States will not be tolerated. I hope you will contact the State Department with this message and work on legislation that addresses this specific problem.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Stop rewarding illegal behavior!
