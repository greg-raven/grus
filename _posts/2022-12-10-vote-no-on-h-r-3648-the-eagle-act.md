In case you missed it, the big Tech companies that are lobbying for the EAGLE Act and more captive foreign workers just laid off more workers than in 2020 and 2021 combined. There is no labor shortage.

The EAGLE Act makes clear that the intention is not to train and employ Americans, but instead use immigration as a perpetual assembly line of new cheap workers to permanently remove jobs from access by American workers who have the audacity to demand fair compensation for their skills and labor.

Reject H.R. 3648.

Sincerely,
