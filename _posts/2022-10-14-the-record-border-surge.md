The Biden-Harris “root cause” migration plan has failed, as is documented in *The Washington Post* column “U.S. arrests along Mexico border top 2 million a year for first time” that was published this month.

Americans are realizing that the Biden administration is wrong on immigration policy and politics.

Roughly 60 percent disapprove of Resident Biden’s handling of immigration. Working class voters of all races disapprove and Hispanic voters want border control.

Please work with your colleagues to implement sensible border controls, including:

Raise the credible fear standard, so that migrants can no longer claim evidenceless fears to gain perfunctory release into the United States.

- End parole abuse (Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is releasing people en masse, with work permits, when parole is supposed to be a case-by-case basis).
- Mandate the Migration Protection Protocols (“Remain in Mexico”) to end the incentive of falsely claiming asylum in order to be released into the U.S.
- Require the Department of Homeland Security to reject asylum claims from migrants who have already passed through a safe country on their way to the United States.

Sincerely,
