The Biden-Harris "root cause" migration plan has failed, as is documented in *The Washington Post* column "U.S. arrests along Mexico border top 2 million a year for first time" that was published this month.

Americans are realizing that the Biden administration is wrong on immigration policy and politics.

Roughly 60 percent disapprove of Resident Bidenâ€™s handling of immigration. Working class voters of all races disapprove and Hispanic voters want border control.

Please work with your colleagues to implement sensible border controls, including:

Raise the credible fear standard, so that migrants can no longer claim evidenceless fears to gain perfunctory release into the United States.

- End parole abuse (Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas is releasing people en masse, with work permits, when parole is supposed to be a case-by-case basis).
- Mandate the Migration Protection Protocols ("Remain in Mexico") to end the incentive of falsely claiming asylum in order to be released into the U.S.
- Require the Department of Homeland Security to reject asylum claims from migrants who have already passed through a safe country on their way to the United States.
