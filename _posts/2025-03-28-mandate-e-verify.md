S. 1151, the Accountability Through Verification Act, would require all employers to run both new hires and current employees through the E-Verify system. Instead of unscrupulous employers being able to drive down wages and take advantage of illegal workers, they will now be obliged to hire American and legal immigrant workers. Additionally, it notifies employers when a suspected stolen or fraudulent Social Security Number has been stolen or is being used.

E-Verify is safe, accurate, and easy to use, and its use is supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This bill is pro-American worker and pro-American business. It will help untold numbers of Americans find work and help to combat ID theft. Please support all American workers by cosponsoring S. 1151.
