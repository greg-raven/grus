I hope that you oppose any lame-duck Congress attempts to pass more immigration expansions to keep wages down and undermine tech workers.

The Seattle Times reported in 2018 that 71 percent of the tech workers in Silicon Valley are foreign-born, and 40 percent in Seattle, many on guest worker visas provided by Congress. And the numbers have steadily increased.

According to a recent NAACP report, "State of Tech Diversity: The Black Tech Ecosystem," Blacks and Latinos in America arenâ€™t getting tech jobs. Black talent constitutes 13 percent of the U.S. workforce and 8.6 percent of STEM graduates, but only 3.6 percent of technical workers, leading Ivory Toldson, director of innovation and research strategy at the NAACP to conclude: "Diversity in tech is a modern civil rights issue, and we cannot afford to be indifferent to the unsettling statistics in this report."

Please work with your colleagues to protect U.S. tech workers, including Blacks and Latinos, by reducing immigration.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. Make E-Verify mandatory.
