We are glad that President-elect Trump and Vice President-elect Pence are committed to building a fence along the Southern border and that many Republican Members of Congress are committed to making it happen. Existing law already gives the president the authority needed to build a fence, and we hope you'll support President-elect Trump in this effort.

We are glad that many in Congress are backing efforts to finally complete the border fence that President-elect Trump has been advocating for. The Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and the Secure Fence Act of 2006 give the president all the authorization he needs to build the border fence.

The Secure Fence Act, passed by large majorities in Congress, requires 700 miles of double-layered fencing along with additional surveillance technology along the border. But the past two Administrations have failed to complete the fence. I'm confident that President-elect Trump will make good on his pledge.

I hope you will do all you can to support President-elect Trump's effort to complete the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and finally support the Southern border.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
