Since its inception in the 1950s, chain migration has caused immigration to skyrocket far above traditional levels. In light of this, I hope you will support a bill to end chain migration.

According to 2000 Census data, the No. 1 cause of exploding U.S. population growth and congestion is immigration. Our population was 203 million in 1970 and has ballooned to over 300 million today. It is on pace to add 130 million more people by 2050, rising to 600 million later in the century. 

Most of this growth is attributed to acts of Congress that have quadrupled immigration rates, especially the system of "chain migration." 

The future of this country depends on you taking leadership and advocating a reduction in immigration back toward more traditional levels. You can do this by introducing a bill to end chain migration. 

I look forward to your thoughts on addressing this important issue.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We don't want the United States to become a third-world country. Please control immigration now!
