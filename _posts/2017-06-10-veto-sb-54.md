I am a California voter who wants you to veto SB 54 if it reaches your desk. As Attorney General, you opposed sanctuary cities because you understood the dangers posed by criminal aliens. Those dangers have grown and SB 54 would further shield them from capture and deportation.

There's a hysteria about SB 54 that does not comport with what Trump is trying to do. He's not making police departments enforce federal immigration law. Police are just being asked not obstruct ICE. On the other hand Senator de Len said he wants to "freeze out"ICEfrom California and limit assistance "to the fullest extent possible." That's a recipe for disaster and possibly bloodshed.

Please stand up for sanity and veto SB 54 if it clears the legislature. There's just too much at stake.
