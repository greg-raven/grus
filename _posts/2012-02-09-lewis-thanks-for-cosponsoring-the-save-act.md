I was thrilled to learn that you are a cosponsor of the SAVE Act!

I know that you have expressed serious concerns about the lack of enforcement of our immigration laws and about the need to remove the jobs magnet. This bill looks to be the right answer that we've all been looking for.

Thank you again for cosponsoring the SAVE Act and do everything you can to ensure it receives a floor vote.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
