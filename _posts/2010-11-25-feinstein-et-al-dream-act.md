It is reprehensible that the Congressional leadership wants to force the DREAM Act amnesty on the American people during the lame duck session of Congress. You need to do the right thing and just say “No” to amnesty!  
  
With people up to age 34 qualifying, the DREAM Act amnesty will apply to more than just teens, not to mention its fraud-prone “humanitarian” and “family unity” exceptions.

Once DREAM amnesty citizens are over 21 — again, many of those who would qualify for amnesty are already that age or older! — they can bring their immigration law-breaking parents back into the U.S. (or keep them here legally after years of avoiding deportation). The chief criminals will be rewarded after all. And due to chain migration, the amnestied “teens” can petition for their aunts, uncles, cousins, and grandparents to get permanent U.S. residency as well.

Any attempt to force this amnesty on the American people during a lame duck session of Congress would be akin to placing a dagger in the back of every one of the 22 million Americans who cannot find a job as it would make it that much more difficult for these Americans to find a job.

Please do the right thing and oppose the attempts of anti-American worker Members of Congress to force the DREAM Act amnesty through Congress. They are acting as if the November 2nd elections never happened and their anti-American worker, anti-American student actions must be stopped.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
