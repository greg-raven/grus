Our ecologically-illiterate immigration policy is pushing us towards half a billion Americans by the end of the century, with some arguing that we should be aiming for a billion to ensure our power and prominence on the international stage.

In reality, the size of a country’s economy does not dictate the well-being of its citizens, and the size of the GDP does not indicate economic health. According to the "United Nations Human Development Index," the standards of living in the world are in no way linked to a country’s demographic size. In addition, the size of an economy doesn’t determine international influence; positive leadership does.

The U.S. Census Bureau predicts that, at today’s growth rate, America’s population will reach 404 million in 40 years, and more than 90% of this increase will be from immigration. I urge you to resist calls for perpetual population growth, and work to reduce America’s high immigration rates.
