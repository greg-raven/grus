Conservative: "Never forget, I did not grant your freedom to you. Your freedom was given to you at birth by your *creator.* Conservative government's job is to *acknowledge* and *preserve* that freedom which is *already yours naturally.*"

Liberal: "Your government has given you many wonderful freedoms, young man ... and now it's time for *you* to *give something back.*"
