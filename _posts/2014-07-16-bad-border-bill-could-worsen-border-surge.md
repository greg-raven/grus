We were disappointed to learn that Rep. McCaul is pushing for his border security bill, H.R.1417, to be part of the House’s response to the ongoing border crisis. Rep. McCaul’s bill would weaken existing law, and given what’s happening along the Southwest border, now is not the time to be weakening existing laws. Please do not support the inclusion of H.R.1417 in your response to what’s happening at the border.

While Rep. McCaul thinks his legislation would help fix the border surge, it would actually make the overall problem worse. His bill, H.R.1417, weakens existing law by requiring DHS to focus solely on high-traffic areas and the Southern border instead of all land and maritime borders, weakens the definition of “operational control”, and could potentially gut the Congressionally-mandated biometric entry/exit system.

Instead, Pres. Obama must be forced to begin immediately deporting people who cross our borders illegally. Until he proves that he’s willing to enforce the actual laws on the books, he shouldn’t be given a single dime, and most of all, the House shouldn’t be weakening existing laws.

Please do not support any effort by Rep. McCaul to include his border bill to the House’s response to the ongoing border surge. Instead, hold Pres. Obama accountable and work towards a solution that will tell the countries of the world that illegal immigration to the United States will no longer be tolerated.
