I hope you will do all you can to make sure you and your fellow Democrats do not shut down the government if the December spending bill doesn't amnesty DACA recipients.

The American people are against any rewards for illegal aliens, especially if the border is not secured, E-Verify is not mandated, and chain migration isn't ended. It would be unwise for Congressional Democrats to hold up a vital spending bill and risk a government shutdown simply to reward people who are in the country illegally.

You and your fellow Democrats need to prove that you are prioritizing jobless Americans and those struggling to make ends meet instead of putting illegal aliens first.
