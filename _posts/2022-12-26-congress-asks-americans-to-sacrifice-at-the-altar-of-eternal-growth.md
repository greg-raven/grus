Stop squeezing Americans with constant immigration-driven growth.

Congress needs to address the persistent environmental degradation in America, such as water shortages, biodiversity loss, deforestation, pollution, and traffic congestion. These problems will persist as long as our immigration-driven population keeps soaring.

Congress could have resolved these issues had they adopted the recommendations of its own 1995 Commission on Immigration Reform, chaired by the late civil rights icon Barbara Jordan. But America's leaders lacked the altruism and courage to reform our immigration system, which is still true. Politicians continue to be more interested in pandering to the mainstream media, as well as to employers of cheap labor.

Even before the recent rush of illegal immigration, the U.S. Census Bureau projected that by 2060 America's population would swell by 75 million people, with over 90% due to immigration. We need courageous leadership to steer our nation away from environmental ruin, and toward a sensible, sustainable course. Please work to reduce America's rapid population growth, namely legislation that would reduce immigration (e.g., stricter limits on chain migration).
