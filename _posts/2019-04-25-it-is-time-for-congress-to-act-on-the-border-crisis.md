You need to take action to tackle the border crisis.

I was disturbed to learn that some of your colleagues are telling voters that there is no crisis at the border because total apprehensions are down. This is false! The number of apprehensions in FY2018 was 31% higher than the previous year. More concerning is the number of "family units" being apprehended. The apprehension of family units over the first 5 months of FY2019 has already exceeded the number of family units in any of the prior 6 years. In fact, if that trend continues, apprehensions of family units could match, or even exceed, the total number of ALL apprehensions in FY15 and FY17.

The crisis at the Southern border is getting worse and Congress' intransigence on this issue is telling people that it's OK to come to the U.S. illegally. The Border Patrol and USCIS need the tools to tackle the crisis, prevent illegal entries, and process those who do cross in an expeditious manner.

You can help the brave men and women working to keep out country safe by supporting legislation to fund more detention beds, fund more immigration judges, close the asylum loophole by strengthening the credible fear standard, and reform the credible fear standard. Our country is counting on you and your colleagues; please don't let us down.
