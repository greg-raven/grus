I am dismayed that Resident Biden is misusing immigration parole to continue to release large numbers into the country while making it less visible on paper.

On July 18 CBS News published an article detailing how more than 500,000 migrants have been admitted into the United States as part of Resident Biden's unprecedented use of immigration parole. The article explains how this number will grow even more.

Biden's border parole program is designed to make the border crisis appear less severe by increasing legal entries for asylum seekers.

Yet the recategorization of border crossers does nothing to help cities struggling with the border crisis. U.S. cities thousands of miles away from the border have declared a state of emergency as they run out of shelter and resources for migrants.

For example, New York City has resorted to handing out fliers at the border to discourage migrants from going there and instead go to other places that will soon become overburdened.

Our communities will continue to be overwhelmed and our workers will continue to be undermined under Biden's immigration parole programs.

I urge you to develop and support a companion bill to the House-passed bill H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, and support the E-Verify bill S. 156, the Accountability Through Electronic Verification Act.
