Did you know that a new Zogby poll finds that most Americans surveyed favor the enforcement-only approach of H.R. 4437?

I support the House, enforcement-only approach of H.R. 4437, and oppose Senate proposals to "legalize" illegal aliens and double annual immigration from one to two million.

A new Zogby poll shows that I'm not alone. It shows that when given a choice between the House and Senate approaches, the public prefers the House approach by more than a two-to-one margin (64 percent to 30 percent).

Please stand firmly in support of the enforcement-only approach of H.R. 4437. This new poll suggests it is the approach favored by most voters.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
