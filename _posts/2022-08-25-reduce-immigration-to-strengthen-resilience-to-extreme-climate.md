During the past 20 years, America has lost more than 11.5 million acres to development. A majority of the loss was a result of the U.S. population growing by nearly 40 million people. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our country is poised to add another 75 million people by 2060 --- with roughly 90% due to immigration.

Clearly growth like we've had is not sustainable. There are plenty of downsides to growth, such as when expanding urban areas become less resilient to natural events and less livable. Every year, more and more Americans become city dwellers, where high-density living leads to more impervious areas, which trap heat and accelerate stormwater runoff --- both leading to hazards like heat exhaustion and flooding, respectively.

We need leaders like you to change our nation's course from a future of expanding cities lacking resilience and livability to one of sustainability. Please support efforts that would reduce America's rapid population growth, namely legislation that would reduce immigration (e.g., stricter limits on chain migration).

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
