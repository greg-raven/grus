High levels of immigration create disconnected communities that make it easier for home-grown terrorists like the ones in Paris and Brussels to plan attacks. Congress should work to reduce immigration to make it easier to assimilate new immigrants and make our communities safer.  
  
High levels of immigration can make assimilation difficult. This situation, unfortunately, makes it easy for young, disenfranchised immigrants to enter a life of crime and terror. As the recent attacks in Paris and Brussels have shown, home-grown terrorism can easily hide in the shadows of crime. To reduce the likelihood of this occurring in the United States, Congress needs to limit future immigration to spouses and minor children of immigrants already here, marriages and adoptions by U.S. citizens, and workers with extraordinary skills in the national interest.
