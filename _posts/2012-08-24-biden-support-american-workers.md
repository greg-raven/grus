Vice President Joe Biden:

As a swing voter, I am counting on the next Administration to support immigration policies that protect American workers. That means no additional increases in greencards.

Over the past three months the economy has created an average of 75,000 new jobs. Yet at the same time, the Federal government has created an average of 75,000 new permanent U.S. job seekers via immigration. For the last three months, job creation has barely kept pace with the number of green cards issued --- a fact that appears to elude many in Congress and the Administration.

By ignoring immigration's role in expanding the job market, you are doing a disservice to the more than 20 million Americans who want a full-time job but cannot find one. Instead, if you are truly concerned about those Americans, then you should make opposing foreign-worker increases a top priority.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. The next administration needs to represent Americans, not foreigners.
