Donald Trump's immigration policies are attracting more and more working-class Black and Latino voters for economic reasons.

According to a recent *Wall Street Journal* article titled "How Trump Boosted His Latino and Black Support --- by Ignoring Party Advice":

> "Among Black voters, Trump has won 20% support or more in three straight polls, two national surveys and a poll of seven presidential battleground states, while Biden has drawn 68% support each time ... a deterioration for Biden from an 83-point advantage in 2020 to less than 50 points in one of the Democratic Party's most important voter groups ...
>
> Trump is drawing more support from Latino voters than any GOP nominee since George W. Bush, current polling shows. His support among Black voters, if polling trends hold until Election Day, would be stronger than recorded for any Republican nominee in exit polls dating to 1972."

Please contact me to discuss how you can work to address the economic concerns of working-class Blacks and Latinos by stopping illegal immigration and moderating legal immigration.
