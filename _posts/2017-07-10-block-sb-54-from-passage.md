Assembly Committees are debating S.B. 54, which would limit communications between local law enforcement agencies and Immigration and Customs Enforcement. This is wrong and dangerous, so I am asking you to block the bill from moving forward in the Assembly.

Despite some Assembly amendments, the bill has not improved. The state sheriff's association says the bill still prevents vital collaboration between sheriffs and ICE officials, and prohibits ICE agents from interrogating illegal aliens in jails.

I get frustrated when I hear S.B. 54 advocates say that Trump is trying to make police departments enforce federal immigration law. That's false. He's just asking that state and local jurisdictions not obstruct ICE.

It's also false to claim that sanctuary policies are needed to protect witnesses or crime victims who are unlawfully present. They are already protected under the federal "U" visa. There are also anonymous ways to report crimes if witnesses are nervous about coming forward. Plus, victims and witnesses are never targets for immigration enforcement unless they are also criminals.

S.B. 54 advocates are on the wrong side of the law and the wrong side of voters like me. Block S.B. 54 from passage.
