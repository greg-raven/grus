It makes no sense to give foreign STEM graduates of U.S. universities a 36-month visa when fewer than half of American STEM graduates are able to find STEM jobs. Businesses employ more than half a million foreign workers under the OPT program, costing Americans hundreds of thousands of jobs, and Social Security and Medicare billions of dollars since employers don't pay into those funds when they hire through OPT. 

American STEM graduates need a level playing field. I hope you will cosponsor H.R. 2315, the Fairness for High-Skilled Americans Act, to end the OPT program and help STEM graduates get to work.
