You have sold out the American people for 14 million illegal aliens who never voted for you, and aren't likely to vote for candidates in the Republican Party which you claim to embrace.

You support of a massive guestworker-amnesty program suggests to me that you have no allegiance to those who elected you or the Constitution that you swore to uphold and protect. 

Your "post-partisan" rhetoric isn't fooling anyone as you've clearly shown that you'd rather surrender to pro-illegal alien legislators and special interest groups than legislate based on the will of the people who elected you to office. 

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
