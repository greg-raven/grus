A story in the *Los Angeles Times* reports that a sophisticated airborne radar system being used along the border has found that more individuals trying to cross the border illegally elude Border Patrol agents than what has been traditionally thought. According to the story, between Oct. 1, 2012 and Jan. 17, 2013, the radar helped Border Patrol detain 1,874 people, but another 1,962 people were able to elude capture.

This report is in contrast to a Governmental Accountability report from 2011 that found that Border Patrol caught 64% of all illegal border crossers.
