I am writing to urge you not to refile charges against David Daleiden, the founder of the Center for Medical Progress, or his associate, Sandra “Susan” Merritt, for their roles in the release of undercover videos that showed Planned Parenthood employees appearing to negotiate the price of aborted fetal body parts, and to dismiss the lone remaining charge. I believe it was a mistake to charge them in the first place.

Citizens and journalists must be free to record and reveal wrongdoing. To do anything less gives protections to criminals at the expense of the rest of us.

Furthermore, bringing charges in this specific case gives the appearance that the Attorney General’s office is engaged in partisan promotion of positions, which denies equal protection to all under the law.

The benchmark for performance of your office was set extremely low by your predecessor. It should be easy for you to do better.
