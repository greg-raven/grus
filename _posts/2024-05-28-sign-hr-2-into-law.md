Get H.R. 2 signed into law to end the border crisis!

The ongoing crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border will not end unless Congress takes steps to change the Biden administration's immigration and border policies. It's clear that passing additional funding without implementing policy changes will only fuel the administration's catch-and-release policies. Congress must get H.R. 2 signed into law to end the border crisis. To refresh your memory, H.R. 2 would:

- plug the loopholes in our asylum system that are exploited by illegal economic migrants, restoring its integrity and protecting it for legitimate asylum seekers;

- block the Biden administration from continuing its policies of catch-and-release, thus deterring future waves of illegal migrants;

- put a stop to the surges of family units and unaccompanied alien children, protecting them from exploitation and victimization by the cartels and traffickers;

- put teeth into efforts to deter visa overstays;

- rein in the breathtaking and illegal abuse of parole; and

- institute mandatory nationwide E-Verify, which would shut off the "jobs magnet" for illegal immigration while protecting jobs for American workers.

It's time Congress steps up to the plate and gets H.R. 2 signed into law to end the crisis at the U.S. / Mexico border.
