E-Verify must be mandated and chain migration must be ended before Congress can even consider passing an amnesty for DACA recipients.

Your decision to sign a letter in support of passing a no-strings-attached amnesty goes against the interests of American workers and our nation's security.

President Trump has made it clear that March is the deadline for dealing with DACA recipients, so there is no need to rush an amnesty into the year-end spending bill.
