E-Verify must be mandated and chain migration must be ended before Congress can even consider passing an amnesty for DACA recipients.

Your decision to sign a letter in support of passing a no-strings-attached amnesty goes against the interests of American workers and our nationâ€™s security.

President Trump has made it clear that March is the deadline for dealing with DACA recipients, so there is no need to rush an amnesty into the year-end spending bill.
