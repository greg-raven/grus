Americans agree that merit should always trump diversity, which is why voters like me support your Executive Order that puts all DEI hires on mandatory leave. 

But it only took two days into your Administration for the lawless bureaucrats at the ATF to openly defy your Executive Order.  

The ATF quietly changed the title of Lisa T. Boykin, the "Chief Diversity Officer," to "Senior Executive" to save her job from the chopping block. 

But thanks to Gun Owners of America, the ATF has been exposed. 

Mr. President, please do what you do best and tell this rogue ATF bureaucrat: "YOU'RE FIRED!" 

This is just another reason why the entire ATF must be ABOLISHED. 

The ATF continues to violate the law by establishing federal gun registries, using violence against gun owners, shutting down gun businesses, and now even publicly flaunting your executive orders. 

This is the same agency that issued a ban on up to 40,000,000 pistol braces after the November 2020 election and before the election had been certified. Thankfully, you rolled it backâ€”at least until President Biden re-enacted it and forced GOA to sue and block it in court. 

Regardless of whether the ATF is issuing anti-gun rules or defying you on DEI, this agency is a part of the deep state resistance to your agenda. 

They're a rogue agency that believes they are above the Constitution, Congress, the Supreme Court, and even the Presidency.  

Congress has already introduced HR 221 to abolish the ATF. Your Vice President also wants to abolish the ATF. 

This is your moment to abolish the ATF and end their vicious tyranny against American citizens who are exercising their constitutional right to keep and bear arms.
