Automatic birthright citizenship should be limited to the children of citizens and legal permanent residents.

An entire "birth tourism" industry has built up around unconditional birthright citizenship. And the border crisis of the last four years will be more difficult to take back if the government automatically gives citizenship to the children of inadmissible aliens who should never have been admitted in the first place.

The United States and Canada are the only developed nations in the world to still offer Birthright Citizenship regardless of whether the parents are U.S. citizens, legal residents, temporary visitors, or illegal aliens in the United States. We should join the rest of the world limiting the practice to citizens and legal permanent residents.
