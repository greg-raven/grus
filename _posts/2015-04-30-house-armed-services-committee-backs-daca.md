It is disappointing that the Gallego amendment to the NDAA passed. Thank you for voting against it and voting against the president's DACA amnesty.

President Obama, in granting legal status and work permits to various classes of illegal aliens, acted outside the law and encroached on Congress' authority over immigration policy. The Gallego amendment was not a vote to strengthen the military, it was a vote to legitimize the president's DACA amnesty.

Thank you for voting against this amendment and I hope you will continue to oppose efforts to support illegal aliens.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
