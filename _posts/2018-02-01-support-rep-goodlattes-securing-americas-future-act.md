I urge you to cosponsor H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act. This commonsense legislation would give work permits and legal status to DACA recipients in exchange for ending chain migration and the visa lottery and mandating the use of the E-Verify system. This legislation would solve the current DACA problem and would make it more difficult for illegal aliens to future illegal aliens to remain in the United States.

In addition to this, the Securing America's Future Act is exactly what the American people want. According to a new Harvard-Harris poll surveyed registered voters and found that:

- 81% want immigration reduced from its current level of 1 million;

- 68% support ending the visa lottery;

- 60% support ending chain migration; and

- 65% favor a deal that gives DACA recipients amnesty in exchange for ending; chain and lottery and increased border security.

H.R. 4760 is a commonsense way of improving our immigration system and allowing DACA recipients to remain in the country. Moreover, voters overwhelmingly support its aims. I urge you to cosponsor it.
