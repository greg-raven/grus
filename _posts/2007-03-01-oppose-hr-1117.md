Any plan to delay implementation of the REAL ID Act will leave the United States vulnerable to future terrorist attacks. Please do not cosponsor H.R. 1117.

A 2005 poll taken at the time when REAL ID was being considered by Congress found that three-quarters of adults agree with the 9/11 Commission that states should require more and better forms of identification before issuing driver's licenses to prevent terrorists from getting them. Almost half of adults would be much less likely to vote for elected officials who made it easier to get driver's licenses. 

In light of this, any move to delay implementation of the REAL ID Act is sure to be unpopular with voters in our state.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. I have real concerns about the REAL ID Act, but we must do something to save our country.
