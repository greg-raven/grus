I believe cosponsoring H.R. 704 to end the visa lottery is one of the most important immigration actions you can take this year. Please follow the House Judiciary Committee’s lead and support this bill!  
  
The visa lottery program is wrought with fraud. A recent report released by the Center for Immigration Studies states that it is common for foreign nationals to apply for the visa lottery multiple times using many different aliases and other false personal information. In addition, the visa lottery program has spawned a cottage industry featuring sponsors in the U.S. who falsely promise success to applicants in exchange for large sums of money.

With 22 million Americans unable to find a job, it is appalling that the United States continues to allow individuals with no special skills to come to this country. These people will invariably compete with America’s unemployed for the few jobs our economy is creating. Is this fair to America’s downtrodden?

The visa lottery encourages illegal immigration and promotes origin-based bias in our immigration system. Please cosponsor H.R. 704 and help unemployed American workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. You need to do everything in your power to reduce the number of immigrants entering the country, and to remove the illegal immigrants already here.
