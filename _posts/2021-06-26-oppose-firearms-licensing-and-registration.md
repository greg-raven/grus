I urge you to OPPOSE H.R. 3740.

This bill would create a draconian and unconstitutional handgun licensing and registration scheme at the federal level. It is an attack on both the fundamental rights of the people and on working-class Americans.

Any registration and licensing scheme advantages the wealthy and powerful who have the luxury of time and disposable income to comply. Any barrier to exercising a fundamental, Constitutional right is an oppressive measure that must be opposed.

I urge you to OPPOSE H.R. 3740, and ALL other firearms licensing or registration bills that may be unjustly filed.
