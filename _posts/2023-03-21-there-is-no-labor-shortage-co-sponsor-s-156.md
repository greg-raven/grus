I urge you to bring those U.S. workers who are struggling on the sidelines into our workforce.

We are missing 6.4 million American workers who would be in jobs right now if we had maintained the labor force participation level we had in the year 2000.

There is no labor shortage.

Corporate interests would rather take advantage of cheaper, foreign labor instead of assisting Americans who are out of the labor market.

Instead, we should work to stem immigration that undercuts and undervalues U.S. labor.

Please support the E-Verify bill S. 156 that will help eliminate the illegal jobs market and make jobs available for our sidelined workers.
