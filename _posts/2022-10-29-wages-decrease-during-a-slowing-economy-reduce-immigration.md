Immigration threatens worker bargaining power even more during a slowing economy.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who predicted rising inflation this year despite his naysayers, believes that "more likely than not" the U.S. will face a recession.

The October 24 *Washington Post* column "Labor movement's next big challenge: Keeping momentum as economy slows" explains how recent worker gains in bargaining can be undermined during recession periods:

> "\[A\]s the economy teeters toward a downturn in coming months, the window for cementing more victories could be narrowing. Already job openings have fallen, and some companies --- particularly in technology and interest-rate sensitive sectors such as mortgage finance --- have ordered hiring freezes and layoffs, igniting fears that the paradigm of power in favor of workers could be short-lived."

Please work with your colleagues to give U.S. workers more leverage by reducing immigration.
