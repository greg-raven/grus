Immigration threatens worker bargaining power even more during a slowing economy.

Former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers, who predicted rising inflation this year despite his naysayers, believes that “more likely than not” the U.S. will face a recession.

The October 24 *Washington Post* column “Labor movement’s next big challenge: Keeping momentum as economy slows” explains how recent worker gains in bargaining can be undermined during recession periods:

> “\[A\]s the economy teeters toward a downturn in coming months, the window for cementing more victories could be narrowing. Already job openings have fallen, and some companies — particularly in technology and interest-rate sensitive sectors such as mortgage finance — have ordered hiring freezes and layoffs, igniting fears that the paradigm of power in favor of workers could be short-lived.”

Please work with your colleagues to give U.S. workers more leverage by reducing immigration.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. Make E-Verify mandatory.
