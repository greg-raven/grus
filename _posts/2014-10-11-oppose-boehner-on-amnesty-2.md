Why did House Speaker John Boehner tell an American Enterprise Institute audience that “immigration reform would help our economy?” How does amnestying illegal aliens and increasing work permits for foreign workers help the 18 million Americans unable to find a full-time job? Businesses are not people and do not deserve low-cost foreign labor when it harms American workers.

Poll after poll has shown that Americans are against any efforts to give work permits or legal status to illegal aliens and are against efforts to increase foreign worker numbers. With this in mind, why did he think it was alright to say:

> “Yeah, I think immigration reform would help our economy, but you’ve got to secure the borders first — we’ve got a mess and I think everybody knows we’ve got a mess. Our legal system is broken, our borders aren’t secure…. And then we’ve got the problem of those that are here without documents. It needs to be fixed …?”

How does pushing “immigration reform” help the American people, especially the 18 million Americans unable to find a full-time job? All of the job growth from 2000 has gone to new foreign workers. Mass immigration hasn’t helped the American economy — it’s harmed it.

I hope you urge Speaker Boehner to reconsider his statement. Now is not the time to move forward with amnestying illegal aliens or increasing green card numbers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
