- Put American workers first

It is disappointing how many in the government and media continue the false narrative that more immigration is needed to solve worker shortages in the United States.

These same businesses are mainly looking for any means to exploit cheaper labor. As has been well-documented, businesses are resorting to hiring child labor, suppressing wages, wage theft, and forced labor while laying off thousands of Americans and discriminating against them in the hiring process.

I urge you to support U.S. wages and job quality with legislation aimed to at stopping immigration increases and enforcing existing immigration laws to reduce the current illegal immigrant population.

Sincerely,
