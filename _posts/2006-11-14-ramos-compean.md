I am outraged that two heroic Border Patrol agents have been sentenced to prison for doing their job. Please pardon agents Ramos and Compean immediately. 

The conviction and sentencing of these two brave men has cast a dark shadow on the open-border policies of the 109th Congress and your administration. It is hard to believe you when you claim that you want to secure the border. You silently condone a system that prevents Border Patrol agents from doing their job while doing nothing to stop these two men from being sent to prison for stopping a known illegal-alien drug smuggler. 

Agents Compean and Ramos were convicted, largely, because the prosecutor claimed that they violated the Border Patrol pursuit policy. According to the president of the National Border Patrol Council, T.J. Bonner, however, "The pursuit policy has negatively affected the Border Patrol's mission as well as public safety. Part of that mission is to stop terrorists and drug smugglers ... The administration is trying to intimidate front-line agents from doing their job." 

Given your refusal to support ATTRITION THROUGH ENFORCEMENT measures passed by the House, your insistence on a guestworker/amnesty program, and your silence on the fate of Agents Compean and Ramos, I find it impossible not to believe T. J. Bonner. 

Nothing would make me happier than for you to prove me wrong by pardoning these men and setting right an egregious wrong.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
