I understand that the Attorney General's report on what gun control to roll back is due soon.  

While there are many unconstitutional gun control regulations I want to see repealed, at a minimum, I expect to see the following inside the report:  

1. Stopping Biden's ban on 40,000,000 pistols with attached stabilizing braces.  

2. Revoking the ATF's "Engaged in Business Rule" that restricts private firearm sales.  

3. Ending the ATF's "Zero-Tolerance" policy targeting gun stores.  

4. Withdrawing the "Frame and Receiver Rule." 

5. Revoking Biden's no-destruction of 4473's rule and eliminating the national gun registry that the ATF has illegally assembled. 

The first three items on this list were explicit promises made to gun owners on the campaign trail that have yet to be fulfilled!  

For four years, Joe Biden tyrannically abused his power to curtail the Second Amendment rights of gun owners.  

It's past time to throw his unconstitutional gun control on the ash heap of history where it belongs!  

I understand that there's a lot that needs to be done to get our country back on track. But for me, there is no higher priority than the Second Amendment to the United States Constitution.  

I'll be watching closely to see what's in the report, and Gun Owners of America will keep me informed.
