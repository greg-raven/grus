Chairman of the Senate’s immigration subcommittee, Sen. Jeff Sessions, wrote an op-ed for the Washington Post calling for “an honest discussion of immigration” and its effects on American workers and their families. I agree that it is time for Congress to have this discussion and work to stem the tide of the hundreds of thousands of immigrants to work jobs that millions of Americans need to have.

In the op-ed, Sen. Sessions described that after changes were made to immigration law to reduce admissions after the first “‘great wave’ of U.S. immigration”, wages for American workers surged “increasing more than 90 percent from 1948 to 1973, according to the Economic Policy Institute.”

He went on to point out that after Congress lifted the immigration caps in the 1960s and the quadrupling of the foreign-born population, “The share of adults who live in middle-income households has eroded over time, from 61% in 1970 to 51% in 2013.”

In order to make sure that “a new population almost four times larger than that of Los Angeles in just 10 years time” doesn’t emigrate to the United States at a time when almost 1 in 4 Americans age 25 to 54 does not have a job, Sen. Sessions suggested, “What we need now is immigration moderation: slowing the pace of new arrivals so that wages can rise, welfare rolls can shrink and the forces of assimilation can knit us all more closely together.”

It is time for Congress to have an honest discussion about why the U.S. should be bringing in hundreds of thousands of immigrants each year to work jobs that millions of Americans need to have.
