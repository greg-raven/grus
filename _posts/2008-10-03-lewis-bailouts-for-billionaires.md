I was very disappointed to hear that you voted for the last "bailout for billionaires" plan. Thank goodness it did not pass.  
  
You have an opportunity to redeem yourself: Vote against the latest "bailout for billionaires" bill, and any subsequent bill along these lines.

Not only is the bailout itself a horrible idea, flawed at its core, but it now has been larded up with other appropriations in an attempt to buy votes.

We do not want this bill or any others like it. We don’t need this bill or any others like it. Furthermore, there is no guarantee that this action will "fix" the problem.

I realize that our political elite has been promising us that we do need it, but they have lied to us repeatedly about this and other issues of importance for years. I don’t trust any assurance about the necessity or wisdom of this bill.

You must absolutely, positively, vote NO on this bill, and any others like it.

Sincerely,
