It troubles me that child migrant labor abuse is still rampant despite the exposure of this nationwide problem by *The New York Times* in the Fall of 2023.

H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, includes E-Verify and loophole closures on migrant child releases to end this abuse.

I hope you contact me soon to discuss ending migrant child abuse by sending H.R. 2 to the President's desk.

Here are some results of child labor investigations from the Department of Labor.:

- Recently, in Alabama, a restaurant chain called Freddy's Frozen Custard and Steakburgers was caught exploiting 149 children over 7 different locations and was fined a mere $119K. How long will it take the 7 locations to recoup that fine?

- Monogram Meat Snacks (founders of the Monogram Foods Loves Kid Foundation) was fined $140K for placing children in dangerous work environments in violation of the law. Compare that fine with Monogram celebrating surpassing $1 billion in revenue in 2021. I am sure that fine really hurts.

- A Baskin-Robbins Franchisee was fined $49,833 for employing 64 kids over 8 locations.

- A Jersey Mike's Franchise owner was fined $108K for employing over a dozen children in four locations.

- Owner of 20 Burgers, Shakes and Fries was fined $11K for employing 13 children.

- The largest Bojangles franchisee was fined $27K for a second round of child labor violations.
