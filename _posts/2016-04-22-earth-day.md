This Earth Day, I hope you will take a moment to realize the impact mass immigration has on our nation’s environment.

In just the eight years from 2002 to 2010, over 8.3 million acres (approximately 13,000 square miles) of farmland and natural habitat in the contiguous states succumbed to the bulldozer’s blade. That is an area larger than the entire state of Maryland — cleared, scraped, filled, paved and built over — in less than a decade.

Mass immigration is mostly to blame. I hope you will act to reverse the trend and save our nation’s green spaces.
