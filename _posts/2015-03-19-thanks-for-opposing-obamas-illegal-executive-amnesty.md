Thank you for voting against the revised DHS funding bill. Leaving the funding for the president's amnesties in tact is the same as supporting amnesty.

I simply cannot understand why so many of your colleagues voted for the revised DHS funding bill. Allowing the president's amnesties to stand, or counting on the courts to quash it, is dangerous. The courts are unpredictable and allowing the amnesties to stand will only encourage more illegal immigration and will only encourage this president to take more executive actions spanning a range of issues.

Thank you for voting against the Senate's bill. Please continue to stand up for the rule of law and please continue to back efforts to defund President Obama's dangerous amnesties.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
