I urge you to support spending legislation for FY18 that will fund border improvements along the southern border.

In 2006, Congress passed, and Pres. Bush signed into law, the Secure Fence Act that called for 700-miles of double-reinforced fencing along the border, but the federal government has yet to implement that law.

Pres. Trump was elected, in part, because of his promise to finally secure the U.S.-Mexico border. His request for funding for FY18 would not pay for a full wall. Instead, it would simply fund fencing in areas deemed as critical by Border Patrol.

I urge you not to jeopardize national security over petty politics. Republicans and Democrats alike overwhelmingly voted for fencing along the border, and it’s time to make good on that promise by providing the necessary funding.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. We must defend our borders to protect our country, our culture, and our lifestyle.
