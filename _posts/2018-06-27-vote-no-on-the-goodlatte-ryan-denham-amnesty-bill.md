Despite the fact that Republicans campaigned against amnesty and for putting the interests of American workers first, a small group of Republicans is attempting to force the Republican Conference to violate their campaign promises in the middle of a border crisis.

> "The greatest asset of the American economy is the American worker. Our immigration system must protect American working families and their wages, for citizens and legal immigrants alike, in a way that will improve the economy ... America's immigration policy must serve the national interest of the United States, and the interests of American workers must be protected over the claims of foreign nationals seeking the same jobs ... We oppose any form of amnesty for those who, by breaking the law, have disadvantaged those who have obeyed it."
