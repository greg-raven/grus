I am writing to you because the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation just declared a "Tier 2" water shortage for the Colorado River and Lake Mead. This trend threatens the drinking water of Southwest cities like Phoenix, Tucson, Las Vegas, and Los Angeles. Leaders like you need to heed the warning signs that America's population growth is unsustainable.

According to a recent (8/21/22) newscast by NBC News, the Colorado River Basin grew by a whopping 1.6 million people during the past 10 years. And there's no end in sight. The Census Bureau projects America's population will grow by another 75 million in the next 40 years, with immigration accounting for roughly 90%.

If you are serious about addressing the water crisis of the Southwest, then I urge you to help by supporting efforts to reduce America's rapid population growth, namely legislation that would lower immigration rates --- simple and fair measures like putting stricter limits on chain migration.
