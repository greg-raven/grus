Americans losing jobs shouldn't compete against additional H-2B workers!

It was very sobering to read that Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin believes we could experience Great Depression-level unemployment if your administration doesn't act to contain the coronavirus fallout. While I know that you and your administration will do everything possible to keep Americans in their jobs, a good first step would be to cancel the issuance of the 35,000 additional H-2B visas that DHS announced earlier in the month. Given the change in circumstances, I cannot imagine why these visas would still be issued.

Please show Americans workers that you are on top of this situation by stopping DHS' issuance of these 35,000 H-2B visas.
