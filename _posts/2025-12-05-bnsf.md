I support the Barstow International Gateway project.

I'm writing because I support the Barstow International Gateway (BIG) project. It's a great opportunity for Barstow, the state of California, and the national supply chain. BIG will keep products moving smoothly and create a lot of good jobs.

It also brings important environmental benefits. Moving more freight by train instead of trucks means less traffic and cleaner air for communities across Southern California. It also will use newer, cleaner equipment that makes this project even better for the region.

Thank you for your time and leadership. BIG is a smart investment for Barstow and the nation, and I encourage you to move it forward.
