Gun owners nationwide oppose the nomination of Xavier Becerra to lead the Department of Health and Human Services.

He supported

1. the Standard Capacity Magazine Ban in California's Duncan v. Becerra calling the measure "sensible and constitutional,"

2. a so-called "Assault Weapon" Registration mandate in Miller v. Becerra,

3. a handgun ban also known as the so-called Unsafe Handgun Act in a case known as Pena v. Horan, and

4. a failed Ammunition Background Check System even though it had a false positive denial rate of over 97 percent at the time in a case labeled Rhode v. Becerra.

If confirmed, Xavier Becerra will surely use the 80,000 HHS employees and $1.3 budget to circumvent the Dickey Amendment to advocate and promote gun control using a loophole created recently by the passage of the anti-gun Fix NICS legislation.

For all of these reasons, I believe that Xavier Becerra is also unfit to serve as our nation's Secretary of Health and Human Services.

I also oppose the anti-gun Judge Merrick Garland to lead the Department of Justice as Attorney General.
