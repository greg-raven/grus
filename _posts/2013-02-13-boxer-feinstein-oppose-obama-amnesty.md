I could not believe that Sen. Schumer said that the border doesn't need to be secure before illegal aliens receive their amnesty and "pathway to citizenship!" What is he thinking?

I want to remind you that Sen. Schumer was one of the masterminds behind the 1986 amnesty that granted citizenship to millions of illegal aliens and only "promised" to secure the border and "promised" to provide a workplace verification program. Now, I want you to read his statement: "We're not using border security as an excuse or a block to the path to citizenship ... \[The Gang of Eight\] wants to make sure the border is secure, but not to use it as a barrier to prevent the 11 million from eventually gaining a path to citizenship." It's easy to imagine that Sen. Schumer is trying to pull the wool over the eyes of the American people twice, isn't it?

I hope you and your Democratic colleagues will oppose Sen. Schumer's senseless amnesty proposal and instead support immigration legislation that secures the border and protects U.S. jobs and unemployed Americans.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
