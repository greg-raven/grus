Northern U.S. cities such as New York, Chicago, Washington D.C. cannot keep up with migrant influxes, living in tents, sleeping on streets, and wandering aimlessly about unfamiliar places. Be a strong voice for border security to help minimize migrants' hardships. A compassionate immigration policy includes border enforcement that will help save the lives of vulnerable migrants who perish in ill-advised journey's north. An estimated 700 migrants have died this year alone in their futile efforts to reach the U.S.

According to a recent Harvard-Harris poll, immigration is a top issue for Americans during this record border crisis, but it doesn't even rank in the top ten for Democrats in Washington. The border issue isn't going away. We need to try something new – or old – to stop illegal immigration.

Sincerely,

P.S. Secure our borders now and evict all illegals currently in the country.
