Please pardon or commute the sentences of Border Patrol agents Compean and Ramos. They have been sentenced to prison for stopping a drug-smuggler.

These agents did not receive a fair trial. Jurors have claimed that they were coerced and the case was prosecuted in a way that demands an impartial investigation. 

A known illegal-alien drug smuggler (who was caught driving a van with 800 pounds of marijuana in it, mind you) was given immunity by the U.S. government in exchange for his testimony. Now he is suing our government for $5 million dollars. This is certainly a travesty of justice. 

Mr. President, I am counting the days to a presidential pardon or commutation for these agents. Every day that goes by is another black stain on your administration. 

Please pardon or commute the sentences of agents Ramos and Compean today.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Don't let them languish in prison one minute longer!
