H.R. 4731, the Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act would establish a ceiling of 60,000 refugees per year and require Congressional approval to change it. It would also reform America's refugee system and make our country safer. I urge you to push for a House vote on this legislation.

The Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act would:

- Set the refugee cap at 60,000 (the average intake of refugees between 2004-13 was just shy of 59,000);
- Terminate refugee status for those that return to their countries of origin (absent a change in conditions);
- Remove DHS's ability to waive various grounds of inadmissibility for refugee admissions;
- Allow recurrent security vetting of refugees prior to LPR status adjustment;
- Bump back LPR status for refugees from 1 to 3 years
- Adjust DHS's authority during LPR adjustment by removing the ability to waive various grounds of inadmissibility, providing that refugees deemed deportable (under most grounds) may not adjust to LPR status, requiring in-person interviews, and requiring refugees denied LPR status to present themselves before DHS every 5 years to determine eligibility to adjust status;
- Prohibit resettlement in states/localities that refuse resettlement;
- Adjust screening process to reduce fraud; and
- Clarify that displacement or generalized conflicts alone do not qualify an individual for refugee status under the law.

This legislation would make our country a safer place and, more importantly, put control of the Refugee program back in Congress' hands. Please push for a House vote on H.R. 4731, the Refugee Program Integrity Restoration Act.
