Don’t support amnesty or guest worker increases!

I was disappointed to read in Politico that you want Congress to pass legislation that would amnesty illegal farmworkers and expand guest worker programs for the construction and building trades. During your 2016 campaign, you promised to reduce immigration and oppose amnesty for illegal aliens. Breaking this promise would alienate the tens of millions of Americans who voted for you and would make your reelection far less likely and would harm your party’s chances of keeping control of the Senate and regaining control of the House of Representatives.

American workers, especially those who still cannot find work, are depending on you and Congressional Republicans to reduce immigration and competition for jobs. I hope you will abandon any plans to amnesty illegal aliens or increase the number of foreign workers allowed to work in the United States.
