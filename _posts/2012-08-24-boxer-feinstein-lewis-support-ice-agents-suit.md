Finally some brave ICE agents are standing up to Secretary Napolitano's DREAM Directive requiring them to violate immigration law. I hope you will support these fine ICE agents and their suit against Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton.

The Secretary of Homeland Security does not have the legal or constitutional authority to bypass Congress and the American people to grant amnesty and work permits to almost two million illegal aliens with the stroke of her pen. Yet that is exactly what she has done with her June 2012 DREAM Directive. It is especially alarming that she would do this at a time when the illegal aliens who will be allowed to remain and work in the United States under the guise of "prosecutorial discretion" will be competing for scarce jobs with the 20 million Americans who are under- or unemployed.

Regardless of whether or not one believes the end-result of the DREAM Directive is a worthwhile goal, the fact of the matter is that federal law enforcement officers should not be asked to violate federal immigration law. It is alarming to me that law enforcement officers could be punished for enforcing the laws Congress enacted. By their various directives, Secretary Napolitano and Director Morton are requiring ICE officers to turn a blind eye anytime they encounter any illegal alien who has not been convicted of a specific violent crime, regardless of how dangerous that alien may be. Instead law enforcement officers should be encouraged to enforce the laws of the United States equally against all law-breakers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. If our leaders won't return this country to the rule of law, we are lost.
