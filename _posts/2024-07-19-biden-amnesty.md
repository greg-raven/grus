I am outraged that President Joe Biden announced earlier this week his executive order giving amnesty for more than 500,000 illegal alien spouses of American citizens this week --- the largest and most expansive executive amnesty in nearly a decade.

Congress holds the power under the Constitution to approve amnesties. This unconstitutional order bypasses Congress's authority.

Issuing an amnesty during a historic border crisis will only encourage more illegal migrants to come to the United States through parole and fraudulent asylum claims.

Please contact me to discuss President Biden's unconstitutional amnesty.

Sincerely,
