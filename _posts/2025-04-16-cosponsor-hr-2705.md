Chain migration is an unnecessary and wasteful program that allows immigrants to bring in their adult relatives --- their non-nuclear family members. Stopping this practice would allow immigration authorities to focus on admitting close family members and clear the immigration backlog. It would also reduce America's immigration numbers that are spiraling out of control.

Ending chain migration is vital when many Members of Congress are calling for a mass amnesty for illegal aliens. If 11-18 million illegal aliens are amnestied, how many family members --- both those outside the United States and those residing illegally in the United States but not eligible for the amnesty --- would be admitted to the country? 

Please co-sponsor and help to pass H.R. 2705, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, before it is too late.
