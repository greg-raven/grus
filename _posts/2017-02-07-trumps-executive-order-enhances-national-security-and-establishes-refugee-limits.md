President Trump's Jan. 27 executive order strengthens national security and establishes limits for the refugee resettlement program. Both actions were highlighted during Donald Trump's August campaign speech on immigration, and the American people responded by electing him president. I ask that you set aside the misinformation that's been reported since the order was signed and support these sensible actions.

The Trump order returns refugee levels to their more traditional level of 50,000. And in 2011-12, before President Obama ramped up refugee resettlement, admissions were below 60,000.

The humanitarian action would be to help refugees closer to their homes. A report from the Center for Immigration Studies found that the U.S. could help 12 refugees in safe zones in the Middle East for the same cost as resettling one in the United States. In a White House statement issued on Jan. 29, President Trump has already taken steps to establishing these safe zones in coordination with Saudi Arabia.

President Trump has also hit the pause button on non-citizens who attempt to enter the United States from 7 countries designated by the Obama administration as hotspots for terror. This temporary pause will allow the new administration to evaluate the procedures in place to vet foreign visitors.

Both of these steps will help ensure a thorough vetting process that aims to keep our country safe. I urge you to support this executive order, too.
