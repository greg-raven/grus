I am a California voter who wants you to block passage of S.B. 54. Preventing police from communicating with ICE about criminal aliens is dangerous and violates federal law. Police may not know what convictions or other offenses are on a person's record, or who that person really is, unless they communicate with ICE. Do not play politics with our safety and well being.

It is false to claim that sanctuary policies are needed to protect witnesses or crime victims who are unlawfully present. They are already protected under the federal "U" visa, and there is no research that suggests crime reporting increases in sanctuary jurisdictions.

Advocates for S.B. 54 are on the wrong side of the law and the wrong side of voters who support Trump's crackdown by large margins.

The Obama Administration acknowledged the dangers of sanctuary policies. The Trump Administration will now cut off millions in federal grants if the state does not back down. This legislation presents a risk to our pocketbooks as well as our lives.

Two 1996 federal laws forbid sanctuary policies that shield criminal aliens from federal immigration officials. 8 U.S.C. Section 1373 forbids policies restricting communication and information sharing. 8 U.S.C. Section 1324 forbids harboring criminal aliens or shielding them from detection. Trump has ample authority to go after California if you support the bill.

California will lose in the courts using a Tenth Amendment argument. One of the few select powers the Constitution reserves for the federal government is over immigration. Besides, its false to claim Trump is making police departments enforce federal immigration law. Police are just being asked not obstruct ICE.

Block S.B. 54.
