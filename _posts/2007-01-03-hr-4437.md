You did the right thing by voting against the Bush guestworker-amnesty solution and in favor of Attrition Through Enforcement, as proposed in H.R. 4437.

"Attrition Through Enforcement" works. We have seen this recently with all the legal workers stepping up to take jobs after the Swift raids drove illegal aliens out. 

In addition, more and more news stories are reporting that illegal aliens are getting fed up as enforcement is increased and returning to their home countries. 

This proves that amnesty and mass deportations are not the only two ways to solve our immigration crisis. Rather, Attrition Through Enforcement, which is preferred by a majority of Americans when they"re given the option, is a third way that really works. 

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
