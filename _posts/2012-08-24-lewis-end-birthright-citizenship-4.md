Representative Jerry Lewis:

I oppose automatic citizenship granted to the children of illegal aliens.  
  
At least 4 million U.S. residents have received this type of citizenship. No one should receive U.S. citizenship as a reward for criminal behavior. It is absurd and offensive. Children of illegal aliens already have citizenship in their parents’ home countries.

H.R. 140 would eliminate birthright citizenship for the children of illegal aliens and tourists. It’s important that this important reform becomes law. I hope you will do all you can to end birthright citizenship.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven

P.S. This is key to the survival of our republic.
