I hope you find the unilateral Obama Amnesty as appalling as I do. This action will harm millions of jobless Americans and will devastate the Democrats at the November polls. I'm sure you won't be supporting this action.

It is particularly irresponsible for President Obama to issue an amnesty for illegal aliens while neither President Obama nor Congress have done anything to reduce the number of Green Cards given out each year to new permanent foreign workers. We have 20 million Americans who can't find a full-time job, and he has just issued an executive order that adds millions of new workers to the labor pool, thus putting even more Americans out of work. Whom exactly does he represent?

I thought Democrats represented the down and out; was I wrong? Shouldn't you and your fellow Democrats be standing up for the tens of millions of Americans who cannot find a full-time job instead of amnestying the millions of illegal aliens who crossed our borders illegally? How is this just or fair to the families of these unemployed Americans who don't know where their next meal will come from? How will Democrats explain this to the electorate in November?

Where do you stand? Do you stand with the more than 2 million illegal aliens that stand to benefit from the Obama Amnesty or do you stand with the 20 million Americans who cannot find a full-time job and their families? America is watching to see where Democrats stand on this and I hope you make the correct decision.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
