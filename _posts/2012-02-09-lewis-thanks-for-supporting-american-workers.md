Thank you for cosponsoring H.R. 2885, a bill that will put jobless Americans into jobs currently held by illegal aliens.

Mandating use of E-Verify would unlock opportunities for the most disadvantaged members of our society, primarily less-educated younger adults. This includes millions of African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans with no more than a high school degree, who suffer long-term unemployment rates of over 30 percent. They are the ones most likely to be seeking the construction, service, transportation, and manufacturing jobs that illegal aliens hold.

H.R. 2885 would put millions of Americans back to work, especially our nation's most vulnerable. Thank you for cosponsoring this legislation.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
