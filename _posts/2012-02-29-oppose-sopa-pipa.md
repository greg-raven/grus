Right now, the same folks that brought us the so-called "Patriot" Act, indefinite detention of American citizens, and an out-of-control TSA and Department of Homeland Security are preparing to wage war on our freedom online.

Two bills --- SOPA (H.R. 3261) in the House and Protect IP (S. 968) in the Senate --- are being pushed by the Big Government leadership of both houses.

These bills give the federal government the power to put someone out of business for even minor copyright violations. In fact, as originally drafted, these bills give the government the power to shut down websites on even a private allegation of a violation. No investigation. No charges. No trial. No jury. No verdict. Entire websites could be shut down for inadvertent violations, malicious attacks, or a made-up claim.

If the government takes the power to regulate the internet and shut down information, no matter what the stated reason, you and I cannot control what they do with that power.

For these reasons I, as your constituent, urge you to oppose SOPA (H.R. 3261) in the House and Protect IP (S. 968) in the Senate, and preserve internet freedom.
