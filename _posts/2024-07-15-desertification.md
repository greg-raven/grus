I am concerned about farmland being overburdened in America and becoming desert. Almost a third of our nation's land area is affected by desertification, and much of the southwestern United States is highly vulnerable.

The best way to protect our arable farmland is to bring down America's rate of unsustainable population growth. But this can't happen while our nation's population keeps growing by millions per year. By 2060, according to the Census Bureau, America's population will grow by more than 50 million, with over 90% due to immigration.

Please work to reduce our high immigration rates to help save America's farmland for future generations. This includes ending asylum and parole abuse, limiting chain migration to spouses and minor children, and/or establishing a nationwide E-Verify system.
