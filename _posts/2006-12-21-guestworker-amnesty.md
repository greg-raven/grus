The Swift raids were incredibly successful. Why would you undermine them by calling for a guestworker-amnesty bill?

You can stop complaining about lazy Americans who are too picky to work certain jobs. Just ask Swift & Co. They have quickly filled the slots left behind by illegal aliens with legal workers --- most of them native-born. The jobs that illegal aliens once held are now proudly worked by American citizens and legal residents of every race and creed. 

Appallingly, you characterized Americans as lazy again during your recent press conference. Are you so desperate for cheap foreign labor that you are willing to spread a lie about American workers? 

If you think the Swift raids were inhumane, why don't you ask those newly-employed Americans how they felt when their government looked the other way while businesses around the country loaded up on cheap illegal labor? Why don't you ask them if they were treated humanely? 

Please Mr. President, stop attacking American workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
