December's unemployment figures are deeply troubling. All must be done to promote job growth!

More then 11 million Americans are looking for a job. This means America's unemployment rate is 7.2% --- the highest in 16 years. Worse still, America's economy eliminated more jobs than any year since 1945. It is clear that Congress must act to help American workers.

There are more than 7 million illegal workers in the United States. These are individuals who have no legal right to work or reside in the United States. These individuals work jobs that millions of Americans would gladly work for a fair wage. Mandating programs such as E-Verify would force rogue employers to hire Americans instead of taking advantage of illegal alien workers. I urge you work with your Congressional colleagues to pass a bill such as the SAVE Act (a bill that would mandate the use of E-Verify).

There are more than ten million out-of-work Americans and they are depending on Congress to create jobs. I urge you to do everything in your power to make job protection and creation Congress' top priority.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
