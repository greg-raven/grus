I hope you will cosponsor and support the S. 179, Sen. Grassley's legislation to mandate use of the E-Verify system. This bill provides for a sensible phase-in of mandatory use of the E-Verify system and will help combat identity fraud. With millions of Americans unable to find a full-time job this legislation is truly important.

S. 179, would, within one year, require all employers to run new hires through the E-Verify system. Isn't this great news? Instead of unscrupulous employers being able to drive down wages and take advantage of illegal aliens, they will now be obliged to hire unemployed Americans and legal immigrants.

E-Verify is safe, accurate, and easy to use, and its use is even supported by the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. This bill is pro-American worker and pro-American business. It will help millions of Americans find work and help to combat ID theft. Please support American workers by cosponsoring Sen. Grassley's S. 179.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
