A.B. 1544, the unconstitutional guest worker bill, is a slap in the face of every unemployed Californian. Please use the power of your office to block this unacceptable bill.

States cannot set up their own guest worker programs. That's federal jurisdiction and no federal waivers exists to implement A.B. 1544. Besides, federal guest worker programs already exist. It makes no sense to duplicate efforts, especially given the state's budget problems.

A.B. 1544 is moving through the legislative process because big Agriculture wants to maintain high profits by employing cheap, illegal foreign workers. You must understand, however, that citizens will not stand for this scam.

Please block A.B. 1544. And if corporate farmers ask why you won't allow it to move, say they have better options, like using the federal H-2A program or paying a living wage.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
