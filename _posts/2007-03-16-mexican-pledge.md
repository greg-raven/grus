Instead of making pledges to citizens of foreign countries, you should be pledging to protect American citizens from the harmful effects of mass immigration.

Whatever immigration and illegal migration is, it is not a humanitarian solution of any kind to the poverty of the world.

Thus, your pledge to help the Mexican people by supporting a guestworker-amnesty scheme is not really in the best interests of most Mexicans.

Rather than focus on improving conditions for Mexicans and their families by emigrating, I believe you should pursue policies to keep Mexicans in Mexico, so that Americans can enjoy America, and you can do your Constitutional duty. It was part of your oath of office. Remember?

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction.
