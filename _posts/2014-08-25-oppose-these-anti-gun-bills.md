I am not in your district, but you are about to vote on a matters that could have direct negative impact on me if passed. Therefore, I am asking that you vote no on SB 53 and AB 1014. I do not support ammunition sales restrictions and registration or allowing my gun rights to be stripped away with restraining orders.

Furthermore, I urge you also to vote no on AB 1609 and SB 808.

Each of these is egregious, but for me, SB 53 and AB 1014 really stand out. As the saying goes, “When government fears the people, there is liberty. When the people fear the government, there is tyranny.” Senator Kevin de Leon is on record as wanting ever more immigration. The only conclusion I can draw is that he fears the very persons he is attempting to get to flood into our country.

No matter what his intentions, though, again I urge you to vote no on each of these four measures. We in California have lost so many of our freedoms over the years, something I know well as a third-generation Californian. Just so you know, I also hold life memberships in the California Rifle and Pistol Association, and the National Rifle Association.

Thank you for your time.
