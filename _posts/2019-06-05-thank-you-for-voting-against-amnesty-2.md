Thanks for voting against amnesty!

Rewarding people who have broken our laws, as H.R. 6 does, only encourages more people to break the law. Moreover, passing a no-strings, enforcement-free amnesty while there is a serious crisis at the border is morally repugnant.

This legislation, if it becomes law, would only make the crisis worse and encourage more illegal immigration. Thank you for opposing this legislation. I hope you will continue to oppose amnesty legislation and will do all you can to end the border crisis.
