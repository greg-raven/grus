It frustrates me that, instead of securing the border, the Administration is allocating large grants that do not even cover the costs of cities overburdened with the migrant crisis.

The New York Times's September column "G.O.P. Gets the Democratic Border Crisis It Wanted" explains:

"The Federal Emergency Management Agency in June allocated huge "shelter and service" grants to cities and states unused to such attention --- $105 million to New York City, $10.6 million for Chicago, $19 million to Illinois, more than $5 million to Washington. Other programs at the Department of Human Services boosted the total federal money to New York to $140 million, and $45 million for Chicago. Those numbers, however, hardly meet the need: Chicago and Illinois alone have allocated about $200 million on migrant care in the city this year."

Communities should not be stretched thin in investing in their constituents because of the Administration's failures at the border.

I urge you to work with your fellow members of Congress to include provisions in H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, in the CR. H.R. 2 includes parole and asylum abuse reforms, child labor protections and E-Verify to end our migrant crisis.

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
