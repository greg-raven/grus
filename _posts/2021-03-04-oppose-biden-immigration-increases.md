The Biden amnesty increases annual immigration by 2.4 million --- please oppose it!

I cannot understand why Resident Biden wants to amnesty millions of illegal aliens, expand the visa lottery, and add millions of new foreign workers while Americans are still out of work due to the COVID-19 pandemic. In addition to amnestying illegal aliens, his legislation would:

- increase legal immigration by 2.4 million per year;
- increase legal immigration in regular categories by 13.4 million over the next decade;
- grant at least 11.6 amnesty green cards; and
- add a minimum of 37 million permanent legal residents of the next decade.

This legislation would be a bad idea in the best of economic times, but would be extraordinarily damaging to American workers during the current pandemic. I urge you to oppose the Biden amnesty.
