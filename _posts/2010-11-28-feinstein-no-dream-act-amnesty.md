It is reprehensible that Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid wants to force the DREAM Act amnesty on the American people during the lame duck session of Congress. You need to do the right thing and stand up to Sen. Reid and just say "No" to amnesty! Otherwise, your chances of winning reelection in 2012 will look dim.

Please do not pay attention to anyone who says the DREAM Act amnesty would only help innocent "children" who are the victims of their parents' lawbreaking. The DREAM Act is not a narrow amnesty aimed only at children; it would amnesty any illegal alien under the age of 35!

The DREAM Act is not a small amnesty for a select group of individuals. In fact, it allows illegal "teens" (i.e., anyone under 35) to petition for their parents, leading eventually to their aunts, uncles, grandparents, and cousins coming permanently to the United States.

In 2007, the big argument for this amnesty is that it is for teenagers who are here illegally because their parents broke the law. Even with the less-than-35 age requirement, this amnesty will apply to more than just teens ("humanitarian" and "family unity" exceptions are added to the age limit). Nonetheless, the argument is that the teenagers should not be punished for the crimes of their parents.

However, as soon as DREAM amnesty citizens are over 21, they can bring their parents, who broke the law to get them into the country in the first place, back into the U.S. (or, keep them here legally after years of avoiding deportation). The chief criminals will be rewarded after all. And due to chain migration, the amnestied "teens" can petition for their aunts, uncles, cousins and grandparents to get permanent U.S. residency as well.

This a back-door amnesty for the parents of these illegal "teens," and a chain migration nightmare for the country. I hope you will take the November 2nd election results to heart and observe the will of the American people on this issue. Just say no to Sen. Reid and just say no to this anti-American worker amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. How about supporting this country and its citizens for a change? Deport all illegals, secure our borders, and return to pre-1965 immigration policies.
