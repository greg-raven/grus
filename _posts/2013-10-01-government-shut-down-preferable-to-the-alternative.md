I understand your frustration with the Senate and White House over the shut-down of the government. However, I would offer you this: Nothing that this government has done since Obama took office has been in the best interests of America or Americans. Shutting down the government is preferable to allowing him to continue to destroy what's left of our country. Furthermore, I hope that your frustration does NOT lead you to caving in to the spendthrift obstructionists, as Republicans seem to be doing these days. Please stand firm, and make this shut-down stand for something. You're doing a great job so far. Keep up the good work!
