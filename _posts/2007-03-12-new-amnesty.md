I've heard that the Bush Administration is claiming it has enough support in Congress to pass its latest amnesty.

While almost everyone has been focused on blocking Sen. Kennedy's latest amnesty, Karl Rove and his White House crew have been shuttling Senators and Representatives in and out of the White House almost non-stop trying to build momentum for a newly hatched Bush amnesty.   I've heard that the new Bush plan includes:  

- Lots of enforcement that may have to go into effect before any amnesty is offered. However, given Bush's record on enforcement, I doubt that it will go into effect before the proposed amnesty, or that it will actually be funded and properly prosecuted;

- 12 million illegal aliens would get at least a temporary amnesty to allow them to remain and work in the U.S. for many years;

- If the illegal alien wants to become a citizen, he has to step out of the U.S. before coming back in to claim it.

How is this any different from Kennedy's and McCain's despised amnesty? 

The net result will be 12 million illegal aliens rewarded with the legal right to live and work in the U.S., enticing millions more illegal aliens to come here. I am told that at least a few supposedly anti-amnesty Members of Congress have already given their approval to this new White House plan. Their willingness to consent reportedly stems from a White House argument that new features make it possible to give illegal aliens citizenship without distracted voters recognizing that it is an amnesty. 

I assure you that I recognize this as an amnesty, and if you support this in any way, you will not get my vote in the future and I will work to see that you are defeated in the next election cycle.

Sincerely,
