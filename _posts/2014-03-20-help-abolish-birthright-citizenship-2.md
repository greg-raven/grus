Birthright citizenship is an outdated practice that lures foreign nationals to the United States so their unborn children can become U.S. citizens. Please work to end this policy that most industrialized nations have already abandoned.

Australia did it in 2007, New Zealand in 2006, Ireland in 2005, France in 1993, and the United Kingdom in 1983. Do you know what all of these nations did in the past 30 years? These nations have passed legislation doing away with birthright citizenship. With Australia's decision to end birthright citizenship in 2007, the United States and Canada are the only remaining industrialized nations to grant citizenship to each and every person born in the country, regardless of his or her parents' nationality or immigration status. Clearly, this ever-shrinking group of nations is not one to which we need to belong.

To grant automatic birthright citizenship to the children of illegal aliens is inherently wrong. Almost all of the entire industrialized world has eliminated it and the United States should as well.

I hope you will work with your House colleagues and help correct this glaring oversight in our nation's development.

The American people, and our nation's future generations, are depending on you to do the right thing. Please don't let us down.
