Thank you for your response regarding H.R. 822 (recognizing reciprocal carry laws nation-wide).

However, you omitted mentioning a key aspect of this issue: The Constitution. As you must know, as you swore to uphold it, the Second Amendment to the Constitution reads:

> "the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed."

It doesn't say anything about rural areas vs. urban areas. It doesn't specify how these arms must be carried. It says Âºshall not be infringed."

Society is safer when the criminal don't know who is armed, a fact amply supported by data showing reductions in crime in areas that have allowed concealed carry.

The president, the attorney general of the United States, the DHS, the DEA, and the ATF seem perfectly happy to supply guns to Mexican criminals, and to launder the proceeds of their illegal activities. All I'm asking for is recognition of my Constitutional rights
