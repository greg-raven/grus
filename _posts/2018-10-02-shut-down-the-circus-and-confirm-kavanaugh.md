We should brook no further delay of a full Senate confirmation of Judge Brett Kavanaugh’s appointment to the Supreme Court.

The latest delay was the Senate requesting the FBI to investigate "credible allegations." There are no "credible allegations."

Lawbreaking, rule-breaking, violence, and disruption have already marred the public Kavanaugh confirmation hearings. The Senate should shut down this circus and move the Kavanaugh confirmation to a timely vote.

Will the Senate allow its confirmation process to be turned into a search-and-destroy mission by partisans with a secondary agenda? The vote to confirm can’t come soon enough. It is shameful that the Senate didn’t vote to confirm Kavanaugh weeks ago.

We urge you to confirm Judge Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court NOW.
