Thank you for voting in favor of H. Con. Res. 14! I'm glad that you and your colleagues are fully-funding the president's border security and immigration enforcement priorities. Please ensure that the final funding is approved so that the Trump administration has the funding it needs to reverse the Biden Border Crisis.
