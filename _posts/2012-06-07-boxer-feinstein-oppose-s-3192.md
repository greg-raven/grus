Senators:

The American people don’t need more foreign workers; we need more jobs. With this in mind I urge you to oppose the SMART Jobs Act, S. 3192.  
  
Here are just a few reasons why I hope you will oppose this legislation:

1. Two government reports have shown that a major reason that tech employers hire foreign workers is as cheap labor. This results in displacing American workers from high-paying jobs in the tech fields.
2. The H-1B program, which is what the SMART Jobs Act expands, plays a major role in the offshoring of high-paying tech jobs.
3. Starting salaries in the computer area, adjusted for inflation, have been FLAT or FALLING for the last 7-9 years. If there is a labor shortage, shouldn’t wages be rising?

The result of the SMART Jobs Act would be to further depress the wages of Americans working in STEM fields and to cause additional job displacement for those workers. In fact, there are 1.8 million Americans with engineering degrees who are either unemployed, out of the labor market, or not working as engineers.

I urge you to help Americans with STEM degrees to find jobs by opposing this legislation and supporting legislation that would reduce the number of foreign workers entering our country.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
