Do not issue a DACA amnesty executive order!

President Obama took unilateral action to amnesty illegal aliens and he was roundly, and rightly, condemned by those who oppose illegal immigration and support the rule of law. With this in mind, I cannot understand why you intend to copy his actions and reward those who have broken America's immigration laws. Such an action would be an affront to the tens of millions of Americans who voted for you.

Please do not take any executive action to amnesty illegal aliens. Any legalization or amnesty for Dreamers must come from Congress and can only happen after E-Verify is mandated and chain migration is eliminated.
