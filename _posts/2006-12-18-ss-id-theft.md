Secretary Chertoff sounds like he is ready to crack down on illegal aliens who steal Americans' identities. Please provide him with whatever tools he needs.

The raids on the Swift meatpacking plants have given hope to unemployed and underemployed Americans across the country. According to The Tribune, in Greeley, CO, "A steady line of job seekers at times backed up to the entrance doors" appeared after 261 illegal aliens were arrested at Swift & Co.'s meat processing plant. That means 261 Americans will likely find a job, thanks to the ICE agents that raided the plant.

Jobs Americans won't do? Not in Greeley, Co, and probably not anywhere else in the U.S. either. This is how Attrition Through Enforcement works.

Secretary Chertoff says that DHS could have detected these illegal aliens much sooner if they would have had the legal authority to review federal data in order to flag Social Security numbers that appear to have been stolen. Please give him the authority he is asking for. Newly-employed Americans across the country will thank you for it.

P.S. Illegal immigration is a weapon of mass destruction!
