America's current immigration levels are far too high. Please work to reduce current immigration levels to fall in line with traditional levels.

More than 15 million Americans are out of work and this number is growing quickly. However, the United States continues to admit more than 1 million legal immigrants each year. Why do you and your colleagues in Congress continue to allow this to happen? Do you not realize that these ludicrously high numbers are not representative of our nation's proud immigration tradition?

For the first 200 years of its existence, the United States admitted about 250,000 immigrants each year. From 1946 to 1970 this number was about 255,000. However, since 1990, this number has skyrocketed to more than 1 million each year! America's current immigration numbers clearly are not in line with America's immigration tradition. Indeed, Congress' refusal to reduce the number of immigrants allowed to legally work and reside in the United States is taking a devastating toll on America's unemployed and underemployed.

I implore you to look at the numbers. You will find that America is indeed taking in far too many immigrants than it can handle. You and your friends and colleagues in Congress can act to reduce these numbers so that America's unemployed and underemployed have a decent chance of finding a job.
