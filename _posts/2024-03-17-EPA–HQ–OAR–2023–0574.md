Re: Docket ID No. EPA–HQ–OAR–2023–0574

I am writing today to express my opposition to CARB's In-Use Locomotive Regulation.

This regulation proposes unrealistic emissions standards for locomotives in California, which could lead to numerous adverse consequences. Implementation of this regulation will result in job losses across the country, disruptions in the supply chain, and potentially higher harmful emissions if freight shifts from rail to trucks. Moreover, it will halt crucial rail facility projects, such as the Barstow International Gateway, that will play a significant role in reducing highway congestion and generating thousands of well-paying jobs in Southern California.

I urge you to reject CARB's approach to locomotive regulation and support more collaborative measures that accelerate commercial viability of lower- and zero-emission locomotives.
