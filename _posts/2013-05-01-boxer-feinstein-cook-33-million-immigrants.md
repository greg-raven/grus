I was outraged to learn that the Gang of Eight's amnesty bill will add 33 million people to the United States' population in the next ten years, and 20 million people every decade after that! How is this just to the 22 million Americans unable to find a full-time job? I urge you to oppose this horrible bill.

Adding 33 million people to our nation's population over the next ten years is the same as adding the 20 largest cities in America to the United States' population all over again. Is this the future we want for our children and our grandchildren? Isn't it bad enough that the legislation amnesties 11 million illegal aliens and permits them to compete against jobless Americans for an ever-decreasing number of jobs? Does America need another 22 million foreign workers in addition to that?

Adding another New York City would be bad enough, but we would also be adding another Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia, Phoenix, San Antonio, San Diego, Dallas, San Jose, Jacksonville, Indianapolis, Austin, San Francisco, Columbus, Fort Worth, Charlotte, Detroit, El Paso, and Memphis. When is enough enough? How is this fair to the 20 million Americans unable to find a full-time job?

Please oppose this bill. The amnesty provisions are bad enough, but the legal immigration provisions are even worse.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. These amnesties are on the path to national suicide. We must return to pre-1965 immigration law, secure our borders, and evict those who should not be here, including "anchor babies."
