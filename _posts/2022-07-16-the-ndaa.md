Thanks for your e-mail about supporting and contributing to the NDAA. Unfortunately, what you’ve done is exactly the opposite of what I expected of you. You might have improved our “national defense” in some small measure, but in the process you also opened our borders and compromised our 2nd Amendment rights. Not a very good trade-off, especially considering how Resident Biden is destroying our military. You of all persons should know that once we lose our rights, we have to engage in bloody conflict to regain them. Thanks for nothing.
