According to the press

The Tea Party: Racist extremists out to destroy America by demanding less government waste and corruption. Questioning authority during a Democrat administration is radical.

Occupy Wall Street protesters: Concerned citizens doing a great service to their country by demanding more taxes and government regulation. Funded and organized by big left but labeled "grass roots" despite the fact many are being paid.
