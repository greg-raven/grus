Unemployed Americans are depending on Congress to improve the jobs situation in this country. How is this supposed to happen when the Democratic Party won't even support common sense solutions like ending the Visa Lottery? Do we really need a program that raffles off U.S. jobs without respect to ability or skills?

Some in the Democratic Party call efforts to end the Visa Lottery "racist." Any attempt to label these efforts with this epithet can only be seen for what they are: desperate and despicable attempts to cater to special interest groups instead of helping American workers get back to work.

How is it racist to end a program that raffles off American jobs when 340,000 Black Americans stopped looking for work last month and 132,000 Hispanic Americans stopped looking for work last month? Is it racist to want to give these Americans hope of finding a job? Why isn't it racist that black teen unemployment currently stands at 39.4 percent?

I hope your party will put jobless Americans first and support efforts to end the Visa Lottery. It truly makes no sense to raffle off so many U.S. jobs each year.
