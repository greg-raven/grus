62% of Americans (nearly 2 in 3) favor a national program to deport all undocumented immigrants, according to a CBS News Poll conducted June 5-7. This number includes a significant 60% of Independents and 38% of Democrats.

I am one of the vast majority of Americans who favor deporting all undocumented immigrants.

I am upset that H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, has not become law.

I am also extremely disappointed that the bipartisan Senate bill and President Biden's Proclamation on Securing the Border give the appearance of addressing our border crisis but only continue mass illegal immigration.

I hope you contact me to discuss this CBS poll showing that voters overwhelmingly support stopping illegal immigration.

Sincerely,
