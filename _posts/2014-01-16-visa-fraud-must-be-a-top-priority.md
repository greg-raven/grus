As a tech worker, I was appalled to learn that the Labor Department has decided that visa fraud is no longer a top priority. How can this be the case when Infosys, one of the largest tech firms in the world, was forced to pay $34 million for falsifying H-1B applications? Americans are losing their jobs due to visa fraud and you must ensure it remains a top priority.  
  
The H-1B program takes jobs from American tech workers, plain and simple. Visa fraud makes matters even worse by allowing foreign tech workers with common skills to take jobs from American workers. This drives down wages for all tech workers. What does it say to Americans who are currently in college STEM fields (more than one-third of American college students are) when the government doesn't rate visa fraud as a "top management concern?"

Congress owes it to all American tech workers and those who will soon be entering the workforce to look into this matter and ensure that the government continues to be vigilant on this matter. Taxpayers, parents, and industry are investing a lot of time and money to produce STEM students and workers and it would be a shame to throw that away.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
