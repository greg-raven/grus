I want to share with you an [𝕏](https://x.com) post that Raleigh, NC Planning Commissioner Reeves Peeler wrote regarding the problems with sprawl. His comments apply to every community in America that is struggling with sprawl.

Peeler condemned NC's growing sprawl, stating:

> "Sprawl is terrible North Carolina. It worsens commute times, makes for worse air, worse quality of life, more expenses for commuters, less potential green space and public lands, and more. It's regressive in every way."

It is noteworthy when officials recognize how sprawl negatively impacts quality of life. North Carolina, however, is only one of many states experiencing growing sprawl due to immigration-driven population growth.

Recent studies demonstrate that the majority of lost open space is a result of the conversion of agriculture and rural lands to accommodate more people. The Census Bureau predicts our nation will add 60 million more people by the Year 2060, with roughly 90 percent resulting from immigration.

I ask that you help to reduce immigration to stop growing sprawl by working with your colleagues to send H.R. 2, the Secure the Border Act, and H.R. 7833, the Nuclear Family Priority Act, to the President's desk. It is a shame that H.R. 2 was not attached to any funding bills.

I look forward to you contacting me about how securing our border and ending chain migration will improve quality of life by stopping rampant sprawl.
