I know you instructed the Attorney General to provide recommendations to you on actions you should take to restore the Second Amendment. 

As a gun owner, below are just a few actions I urge you to take: 

First off, I want your presidency to replace the failed White House Office of Gun Control with a pro-gun office to oversee implementation of your Executive Order Protecting Second Amendment Rights and to help make America safe again. 

The federal government has been so deeply influenced by anti-gunners for so long that it's infected nearly every tentacle of the executive branch. 

You personally know how corrupt and untrustworthy the FBI is. 

Well, in a recent Federalist article by John Lott --- a former senior advisor for research and statistics at the Department of Justice --- reveals how Biden's FBI was distorting gun data, which was, in turn, used to justify the implementation of gun control. 

Pro-gun and pro-Constitution office in the White House would be able to provide your Administration with accurate crime statistics and firearms data. 

Next, it's mission critical that you appoint a pro-gun ATF Director --- NOT an entrenched "seasoned bureaucrat" who will do business as usual.  

That means someone who will: 

- Stand up to ATF's rogue officials; 

- Help President Trump downsize the federal government (including ATF); 

- Unravel Biden's weaponization of law enforcement (especially ATF); 

- Scale back the ATF's infringements of constitutional rights; and 

- Return freedom to the hands of the people to whom it belongs. 

And finally, the ATF's illegal gun registry MUST be permanently deleted. Not only is there absolutely no reason for the ATF to have a digital searchable database of 920 MILLION records on gun owners, it's simply unconstitutional. 

I urge you to ensure that all three of the above items make it into your final executive action to restore the Second Amendment.
