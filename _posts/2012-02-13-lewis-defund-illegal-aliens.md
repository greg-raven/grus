Representative Jerry Lewis,

Americans and legal immigrants should not have to pay the price for the government's refusal to stop illegal aliens from coming into this country. Please support the Child Tax Credit Integrity Preservation Act (H.R. 3444) so that illegal aliens are no longer allowed to claim the Child Tax Credit.

Most illegal aliens come to the United States because they know our country is a pushover. They know they will be able to get a job without much hassle. They know they will be able to get welfare and other social services without much hassle. And they know they will almost have to commit a capital offense in order to get deported. Heck, why wouldn't a person who doesn't want to stand in line and come to American the right way come in through the back door?

Allowing illegal aliens to claim the Child Tax Credit is just another example of why illegal aliens come to the United States and why they stay in the United States. Unless we change our laws (and start enforcing the laws already on the books) nothing will ever change.

You can help to change this perception of America by supporting the Child Tax Credit Integrity Preservation Act. You can begin to tell illegal aliens that the United States isn't going to be a pushover any longer and that we are going to start enforcing the law. Otherwise, the lawlessness can continue and illegal aliens can continue to flood in. The choice is yours.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
