H.R. 5038, the so-called Farm Workforce Modernization Act, is a terrible bill that rewards businesses that have knowingly broken U.S. immigration laws, reward illegal aliens with work permits (after a period of indentured farm servitude), and harm U.S. and legal immigrant workers by increasing the number of H-2A visas issued each year by 40,000.

I am bitterly disappointed that you voted in favor of this legislation. American workers are harmed by this bill and illegal workers and renegade business owners are rewarded. In the future, please consider the ramifications of such bills before you support them.
