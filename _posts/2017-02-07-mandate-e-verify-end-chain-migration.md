During the GOPâ€™s upcoming policy retreat in Philadelphia, I urge you and your fellow Republicans to make mandating use of the E-Verify system and ending chain migration legislative priorities, as doing so would fulfill GOP campaign promises to stand up for American workers.

Mandating use of the E-Verify system and ending chain migration must be the primary immigration priorities for the upcoming Congress. Mandating E-Verify use would end the jobs magnet that attracts illegal labor and eliminating non-nuclear chain migration would cut the flow of unnecessary low-skilled workers into the country. Additionally, a recent poll conducted by Pulse Opinion Research shows that more than 90% of Republican voters, and 78% of all American voters, support requiring employers to verify the work eligibility of their new hires.

I urge you and your fellow Republicans to make mandating E-Verify and ending chain migration your primary immigration priorities. President Trump can beef up the border using his executive authority and Congress must act to eliminate the jobs magnet and eliminate the flow of cheap unskilled labor into the country.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,
