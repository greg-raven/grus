I hope you'll tell Rep. Pence you are not on board with his guestworker program.

Although Rep. Pence does not include the amnesties or giant green card increases of the Senate immigration bill (S. 2611), his proposal is much closer to the Senate plan than the House's enforcement-only bill (H.R. 4437). 

Under Rep. Pence's plan, a guestworker must either return home or begin the process of seeking citizenship after the guestworker's visa has expired. Does Rep. Pence really believe any guestworker will go home? Surely most will apply for citizenship. As well, Rep. Pence's plan doesn't include any prevailing wage standards, meaning employers can race each other to the bottom of the wage barrel while Americans and legal immigrants get squeezed out of their jobs. 

Rep. Pence may oppose amnesty, but his proposal comes too close for comfort in my opinion. I'm counting on you to oppose it. 

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. There can be no reward for breaking our laws.
