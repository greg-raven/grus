Please consider the impact of mass immigration on the quality of life of your constituents.

No one who regularly commutes has ever said that there are too few cars on the road, yet more traffic, more congestion, and more frustrated commuters are exactly what politicians and policymakers seem to think Americans want.

The Census Bureau projects that the U.S. population will increase to 404 million by 2060. Our transportation systems are inadequate for the population we have right now.

How will we deal with 75 million more people? The best solution is not more housing and roads, more sprawl and congestion.

The current level of immigration is the reason the U.S. population is growing so rapidly. Reducing immigration to a more moderate level will improve the quality of life in America right now and will have long-lasting benefits for future generations.

Many voters like myself recognize that bigger is not always better. Does Congress?
