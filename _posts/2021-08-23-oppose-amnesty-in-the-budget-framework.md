I vehemently oppose adding an amnesty for millions of illegal aliens in budget reconciliation.

Earlier this month, the U.S. Senate passed a budget reconciliation blueprint that instructs the Senate Judiciary Committee to include a mass amnesty in the Democrats' $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation effort. But before they can begin the process, the House must approve the Senate-passed budget framework.

This is the biggest mass amnesty threat since the Gang of 8 amnesty bill in 2013. Most legislation requires 60 votes to pass in the Senate. By using the budget reconciliation process, however, Democrats can secure an amnesty for an estimated 8 million illegal aliens without a single Republican vote in the Senate.

However, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is working with a thin Democratic margin in the House. If only four House Democrats and all House Republicans vote against the budget reconciliation resolution this week, it could cause Democrats to rethink the effort, including the inclusion of a mass amnesty for illegal aliens. You could be the deciding vote!

A House vote on the budget reconciliation blueprint could come as soon as tomorrow. Please oppose adding an amnesty to budget reconciliation.
