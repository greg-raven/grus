Today we supposedly celebrate "Earth Day." Until 1970, this day was known as the birthday of Lenin, the leader of the Bolshevik Revolution and first head of the Soviet state. Perhaps we should call it "Watermelon Day" --- the day on which each of us looks Green on the outside while remaining Red on the inside.

Lest you think the linkage between Earth Day and communism merely coincidental, consider that we are told by our modern-day environmental "leaders" that humans --- particularly American humans --- are responsible for climate woes. They even invent climate woes for which Americans are responsible.

Yet at the same time, we are told that we need to add millions more Americans by turning Mexicans into Americans, allowing them to cross the border illegally so they can make our lives so much better than they would otherwise be.

Most persons can see that importing hordes of people, as we have been, is detrimental to every aspect of our infrastructure: schools, roads, water supplies, hospitals, emergency rooms, waste-water processing, sanitation, land fills, etc. You'd think that environmentalists would be especially sensitive to issues such this. As it stands, though, most environmentalists seem unable to decide whether they want redwoods or illegal immigrants.
