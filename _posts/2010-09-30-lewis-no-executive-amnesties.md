I hope you find Resident Obama's willingness to circumvent Congress and allow USCIS and ICE to issue de fact amnesties to illegal aliens as repulsive and outrageous as I do. Please ask to become an original cosponsor of Rep. Lamar Smith's HALT Act so that this practice is stopped at once.

USCIS' recent memo outlining ways of amnestying illegal aliens says the following: "rather than making deferred action widely available to hundreds of thousands and as a non-legislative version of "amnesty", USCIS could tailor the use of this discretionary option for particular groups such as individuals who would be eligible for relief under the DREAM Act ... or under section 249 of the Act ..." So, apparently Resident Obama's pro-amnesty appointees understand that it looks bad to pardon all illegal aliens at once, so it would be better to pardon illegal aliens in smaller groups. Unfortunately, this seems to be occurring.

In a recent memo to staff, ICE chief John Morton ordered ICE agents to halt deportation proceedings against all but the most violent illegal aliens, thereby allowing "innocent" illegal aliens to live freely in the United States without fear of arrest or deportation. It seems that while Resident Obama is considering ways of making the DREAM Act amnesty U.S. law by executive order, he has no problems allowing ICE to grant de facto amnesties to illegal aliens by simply refusing to prosecute them.

I hope you are as outraged by these actions (or, in some cases, non-actions) as I am. Rep. Lamar Smith is outraged at these actions as well and will soon be introducing his HALT Act, a bill that would prevent the Obama Administration from issuing such de facto amnesties in the future. I hope you will call Rep. Smith's office and ask to become an original cosponsor of the bill.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. Don't let the illegal alien in the White House control our immigration policy!
