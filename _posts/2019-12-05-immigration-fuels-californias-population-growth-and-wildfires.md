Why are people in California living in fire-prone areas? Because population overgrowth is pushing them there!

According to Jon Keeley, a research scientist at the U.S. Geological Survey, "Population growth is making (wildfires) more deadly but it's also making them more likely."

CNBC's John W. Schoen reports in "Warming climate, population sprawl threaten California's future with more destructive wildfires" (November 9, 2019):

"A growing population, spread out into forested regions largely uninhabited until recently, is placing people and nature more at risk of being burned."

So why shouldn't we set immigration at a level that would allow for the U.S. population to stabilize?
