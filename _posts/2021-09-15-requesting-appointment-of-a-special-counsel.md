RE: In Support of Investigations and Lawsuits Aiming to Unearth the Truth About the Real Biden Corruption Scandals

There is substantial evidence from documents and witness statements that the Biden family, including President Joe Biden, may be involved in criminal activity involving foreign entities tied to Ukraine and China. Joe Biden’s son Hunter has acknowledged that he is the target of an active FBI criminal investigation.

A special counsel should immediately be appointed because the Justice Department is conflicted investigating any matter that could implicate President Biden or his immediate family.

I, the undersigned citizen of the U.S., Greg Raven, residing in Apple Valley, CA, hereby demand that a special counsel be named to investigate all the facts, evidence, and credible allegations related to overseas "pay-to-play" corruption involving Hunter Biden and his father, Resident Joe Biden.
