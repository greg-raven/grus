I am glad that you voted in favor of H.R. 22, the SAVE Act! Ensuring that illegal aliens cannot register to vote in federal elections eliminates a potentially powerful reward for illegal immigration and keeps our elections secure and fair. I hope you will continue to take action to stem the tide of illegal aliens and remove the rewards that encourage them to illegally live and work in the United States.
