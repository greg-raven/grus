It is important that you support Sen. Ben Nelson's efforts to ensure that American workers benefit from any economic stimulus.  
  
Sen. Nelson, along with Sen. Jeff Sessions, wrote a letter to Majority Leader Harry Reid, urging him to ensure that American workers, not illegal workers, benefit from the economic stimulus package. Sens. Nelson and Sessions' letter states: "An important step toward guaranteeing that new and existing jobs are for U.S. citizens is to require businesses benefiting from the stimulus package to use the E-Verify program. Currently, E-Verify is a voluntary program that allows for the quick comparison of an employee's personal information with over 444 million records in the SSA database and more than 60 million records in the DHS immigration database. Such an analysis is a useful and efficient tool to determine lawful citizenship. We are encouraged by the fact that close to 2,000 new businesses register to use the E-Verify system each week. And, with the implementation of Executive Order 12989 on January 15, 2009, all federal contractors and subcontractors are required to use the E-Verify system."

I urge you to do all you can to support Sen. Nelson's and Sen. Sessions' efforts.
