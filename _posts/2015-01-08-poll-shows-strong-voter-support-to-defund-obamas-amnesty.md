I want to make you aware of a recent poll of Republican voters. "The People's Poll" found that an overwhelming majority of Republican voters, not only oppose President Obama's executive actions granting amnesty and work permits to millions of illegal aliens, but will not reelect Members of Congress who fund it. I urge you to side with those who elected you by defunding President Obama's amnesty.

The poll, conducted by EMC Research, found that 81% of Republican voters oppose "President Obama's recent executive action on immigration." 90% of self-identified Tea Party voters oppose the executive action.

When asked whether "Congress should stop Obama's granting of amnesty to illegal immigrants by passing a law that prevents the administration from using taxpayer money to implement the executive order," more than seven in 10 Republican voters indicated that Congress should do so.

Republican voters overwhelmingly agree that President Obama's executive action is unconstitutional. 89% of those polled "believe that he has exceeded his Constitutional authority by acting alone without Congressional approval."

The poll also found that 83% of Republican voters from this past midterm election would be less likely to support their Member of Congress' reelection if they "allowed taxpayer money to be spent implementing the President's amnesty plan." Of these voters, almost two-thirds would be "much less likely."

I urge you to side with those who elected you and want to see Congress defund President Obama's amnesty.

P.S. I'm starting to despair about you, given your support for Boehner. Uphold your oath of office and represent us citizens!
