As you know, the House of Representatives just voted for TWO pieces of anti-gun legislation. Rep. Speier’s amendment to the NDAA, which lays the groundwork for Resident Biden’s vision of mandatory gun storage laws, and H.R. 6538, which is a duplicative program that will lead to deceptive anti-gun propaganda under the guise of “awareness.”

More gun control has been passed in this Congress than any other in decades. Stand up for my rights and do not allow H.R. 6538 to pass or any gun control to be included in the Senate NDAA.
