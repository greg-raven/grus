The simplest way to end illegal immigration is by requiring all employers to use E-Verify. I hope you'll support this commonsense solution and push for a vote on legislation that would mandate E-Verify nationwide.

E-Verify is easy to use and has the highest satisfaction rates of any government program. Requiring employers to run new hires through E-Verify, as government contractors are already required to do, would prevent the hiring of illegal aliens and therefore discourage future illegal immigration.

More importantly, 81% of likely voters, including me, support E-Verify. I urge you to support it, too!
