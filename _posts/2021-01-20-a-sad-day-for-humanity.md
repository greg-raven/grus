Today is a sad day for America and for human-kind. With this transition to the Harris/Biden administration, the American republic is over. Freedom here and around the world no longer has a champion. Corrupt politicians, hypocrites, pedophiles, race baiters, globalists, and the Deep State now control virtually every aspect of our lives, with two of the most stupid and corrupt among them as the figureheads overseeing our destruction.

Even had we been blessed with four more years of Trump in the White House, it would have been only a slight pause in our eventual descent into the abyss toward which we now are accelerating, in a degraded America where progressives normalize the abnormal and demand our servitude with zero gratitude or appreciation for how we gained our freedoms or our exalted lifestyle.

I predict that within a very short time, America will resemble Venezuela, complete with mind-boggling inflation, even more government interference into our lives, and with the Communist Chinese holding the reins.

As the saying goes, you can vote yourself into socialism but you have to shoot your way out. America is facing two options: A bloody civil war or the loss of everything given us by our Founding Fathers.

I hope Iâ€™m wrong, but I can see no indications that this well end well.
