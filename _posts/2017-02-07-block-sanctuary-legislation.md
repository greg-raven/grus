I cannot fathom why the Senate is considering legislation to further shield criminal aliens from deportation. How many more like Kate Steinle have to die before California leaders understand that criminal aliens must be removed, not released. Use the authority of your office to end debate on SB 54. You'll also be helping to prevent the budget meltdown that will occur when the Trump Administration cuts our federal funds.

California is already in violation of two 1996 federal laws forbid sanctuary policies that shield criminal aliens from federal immigration officials. 8 U.S.C. Section 1373 forbids policies restricting communication and information sharing. 8 U.S.C. Section 1324 forbids harboring criminal aliens or shielding them from detection. Trump will have even more reason to sanction California if you let this bill pass.

Sanctuary advocates claim its unconstitutional (10th Amendment violation) to force local police to enforce federal immigration law. That's a red herring. Simply cooperating with federal immigration agencies does not turn local officers into de facto immigration officers because Immigration and Customs Enforcement (I.C.E.) makes the decisions on which aliens are targeted for deportation. Trump is just asking local police departments not to obstruct ICE from deporting alien criminals.

The Tenth Amendment says the powers not delegated to the United States are reserved to the States or the people. But one of the few select powers the Constitution reserves for the federal government is immigration. That's why California will lose this ridiculous and dangerous political fight.

Please stand up for sanity and stop SB 54. There's just too much at stake.

P.S. Let's get into compliance with Federal immigration law for a change.
