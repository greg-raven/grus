I learned on CNN yesterday that serious corruption at DHS is threatening national security.

The San Diego Union Tribune news story about a high-ranking government official who has witnessed first-hand corruption and misconduct at DHS should call into serious question DHS's ability to handle the significantly increased workload that would result from a massive guestworker-amnesty program.

The fact that this official had to resign to warn the American people of the danger they face, suggests to me that the situation is pretty serious.

Please immediately look into this security concern.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. This is further proof that giving up our freedom is not gaining us "security." We must secure our borders and evict illegals!
