It troubles me that the Democratic party is intent on sabotaging U.S. workers through mass immigration.

In March of 2021, when the Biden administration’s policies were already clearly leading to a surge at the border, House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler said the real crisis "consists of a shortage of workers."

Earlier this year, Senate Democratic Whip Dick Durbin joined other Democrats in saying that the best way to fight inflation would be to increase immigration to slow wage growth.

I learned that House Speaker Nancy Pelosi stated just last week that more immigrants are needed because of a labor shortage.

Writer and author Batya Ungar-Sargon was correct in writing about Pelosi’s immigration stance undercutting worker gains:

> "You know how you undo those gains? Import an entirely new working class from a failed socialist state made up of people who are willing to work for much less money than an American worker. Undercut working-class Americans by opening the border and signaling to the working class of other countries that there is work for them here."

Working-class voters are challenged now with inflation and recession and layoff fears. Statements like Pelosi’s show how the Democratic party is abandoning the working class by pushing for mass immigration that sabotages working-class wages.

Please work with your colleagues and stop pushing for mass immigration that undermines worker gains.
