Yesterday, Rep. Joe Garcia went on a Google+ forum to discuss H.R. 15, the Democrat's amnesty legislation. Unfortunately, it turned out that he was unaware that the legislation would increase unemployment and decrease wages for American workers. I hope you will not make Rep. Garcia's mistake of sponsoring this legislation.

Rep. Garcia also invoked the 1986 amnesty while answering the same question; he said that "jobs were created" as a result of the amnesty. What he failed to mention is that the amnesty failed in its main objective: securing the border and stopping future illegal immigration.

During his online appearance, Rep. Garcia also indicated the bill was good for the economy because the Chamber of Commerce backed it. He forgot to mention that other special interest groups such as the SEIU, La Raza, AFL-CIO, and Silicon Valley technology companies are backing the legislation. One group not backing the legislation is the American people.

I hope you will not make the same mistake as Rep. Garcia. Please do not support this legislation.
