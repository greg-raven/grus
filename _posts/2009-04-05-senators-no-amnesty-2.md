It is absolutely appalling that so many Americans (13.2 million as of March) are unemployed. Luckily, Vice President Biden's recent comments in Costa Rica make it clear that now is the wrong time to support any sort of mass amnesty.

During his recent trip to Costa Rica, the vice president said, "It's difficult to tell a constituency while unemployment is rising, they're losing their jobs and their homes, that what we should do is in fact legalize (illegal immigrants) and stop all deportation."

I completely agree with Vice President Biden's sentiments. How can Congress or the President push for "comprehensive immigration reform" (amnesty) when more than 13.2 million Americans are out of work? This means that 8.5% of all Americans who want a job are unable to find one. This is the highest unemployment has been since 1983!

I urge you to consider the ramifications a mass amnesty would have for unemployed Americans. Currently, 7.7 million illegal aliens have jobs. If these workers were amnestied, 7.7 Americans would become perpetually unemployed. This fact alone should prevent you or your Congressional colleagues from supporting any mass amnesty.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. And this comes at a time when 138,000 More foreign workers received work permits. Stop the insanity!
