I hope you are contemplating what can be done to prevent the caravan of Central American economic migrants from illegally entering the U.S. and claiming asylum.

Due to major flaws in our asylum laws, these economic migrants will most likely be granted asylum. H.R. 4760, the Securing America's Future Act, would help to end asylum fraud.

Our nation's asylum laws are hopelessly flawed, making it easy for almost anyone to commit asylum fraud without fear of prosecution or deportation.

The approaching caravan of economic migrants is proof of this. H.R. 4760 would fix the "credible fear" provision of U.S. asylum law that makes it so easy for economic migrants to fraudulent claim asylum.

Please do all you can to get this legislation passed!
