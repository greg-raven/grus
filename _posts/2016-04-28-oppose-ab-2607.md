As a resident of California, I respectfully urge you to OPPOSE Assembly Bill 2607. This bill will do nothing to reduce the California violent crime rate and would only hurt the law-abiding gun owners of California.

Assembly Bill 2607 would amend the "Gun Violence Restraining Order (GVRO)" procedures that were created by AB 1014 (2014).

I oppose the current GVRO procedures because of the lack of due process when depriving an individual of their right to keep and bear arms. AB 2607 would compound the existing problems by significantly expanding the class of individuals who could seek a GVRO.

Once again, I respectfully urge you to please OPPOSE Assembly Bill 2607.
