Barack Obama

It is detrimental to the security of the populace for you to attempt to defund the 287(g) program in your FY2013 budget request. I fail to understand how a commander-in-chief can end a program that saves lives and removes criminals from the streets. Clearly, you are putting your political interests above the interests of the American people.

While you may not realize that the 287(g) program is necessary to keep Americans safe, the men and women who actually put their lives on the line on a daily basis do realize this. Harris County (Tx.) Sheriff Adrian Garcia, when told about the president's plan to defund 287(g), said, "Elimination of 287(g) would mean the failure to refer to ICE for possible removal many violent, dangerous, experienced criminals who had no previous contact with ICE before being charged with a state crime in Harris County."

Unfortunately, you don't seem to care about violent illegal aliens who pose a threat to citizens of Harris County, or any other jurisdiction. Sadly, you're more concerned with getting in the good graces of those who dislike the program (i.e. those who want illegal aliens to remain in the country). It certainly is a sad state of affairs when the President of the United States favors law breakers over those who observe the law.

I urge you protect all Americans and to give a helping hand to those who enforce America's laws by ensuring that the 287(g) program is fully funded for 2013, instead of siding those who want our laws ignore and want to emasculate those who enforce the law. This is a very important program that gets results --- which is exactly why its detractors want to bring it down.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. You really don't give a shit about this country, do you? You're a sad excuse for a human being.
