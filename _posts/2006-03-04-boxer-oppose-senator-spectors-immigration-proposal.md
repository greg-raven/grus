I am writing to ask you to firmly oppose Sen. Specter’s amnesty for illegal aliens.

I agree with Senator Feinstein that the Senate must pass a bill that is compatible with House bill that passed in December. I agree that illegal immigration isn’t just about people coming for jobs as Sen. Kyl wisely pointed out — dangerous criminals come as well. I agree with Senator Durbin that amnesty will only encourage more illegal immigration and that workplace enforcement must be the cornerstone of interior enforcement.

But I am terrified that there are members of the United States Senate that believe we should give up on the border (Kennedy), or that legalizing law-breakers should be a first priority (Specter), or that we need illegal aliens so some Senators can play on nice golf courses (Graham)!

This is a disgrace of representative government! Do these Senators represent their constituents or their corporate campaign contributors?

Ultimately, isn’t the real question — the obvious question — that we need to decide whether we want to have people here illegally or not? As Senator Sessions said: Enforcement must come first. There is nothing “harsh” about asking people to follow the law.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. I’m counting on you to help protect our nation.
