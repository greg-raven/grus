We are appalled that Costa Rica, El Salvador, and Mexico can get away with striking an immigration deal that will increase the number of people trying to enter the U.S. illegally! The just-signed agreement allows Costa Rica to fly Cuban illegal aliens to El Salvador, where they will be bused to Mexico. This is absurd and will only encourage more economic migrants from Cuba to try to come to the U.S. illegally. Rep. Paul Gosar's Ending Special National Origin-Based Immigration Programs for Cubans Act of 2015, H.R. 3818, would scrap the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 and the "wet foot/dry foot" policy that applies to Cubans entering the country illegally. We hope you will support this legislation.

Recent news stories highlight the need to normalize immigration rules for Cuban illegal aliens. According to the South Florida Sun-Sentinel, many Cuban immigrants are taking advantage of America's special immigration laws for Cubans to come to the United States to receive welfare checks. This money is then used to take long vacations back in Cuba or to return to Cuba permanently. This attitude toward their native country is not indicative of a repressive regime, but of a poor country.

Costa Rica's recent deal to send thousands of stranded Cubans to Mexico represents a clear threat to our nation's security. If Cuban economic migrants know they can get into the United States illegally simply by going to a Central American country and refusing to return home, many more will try.

Rep. Gosar's legislation would repeal the Cuban Adjustment Act of 1966 and end the "wet foot/dry foot" policy and welfare guarantees that draw Cubans to enter the U.S. illegally. I hope you will cosponsor his legislation, H.R. 3818.
