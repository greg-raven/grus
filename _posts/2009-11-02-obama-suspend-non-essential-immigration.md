We cannot understand why the United States continues to import 125,000 foreign workers each month while 15 million Americans are out of work. The $1.5 billion jobs stimulus will not help Americans find work as long as they have to compete against less-expensive foreign workers!

America grants 125,000 green cards and temporary work permits each month. Most of these immigrants are of working age and do not possess extraordinary skills. This means that on arrival or upon receiving permanent residency they compete against America's 15 million unemployed for an ever-shrinking number of jobs. Why is this being allowed to happen?

With this in mind, it's easy to see why the $1.5 billion dollars spent on the creation of jobs has not resulted in a decrease in the number of unemployed Americans. How can Americans be expected to find work when they have to compete against 1.5 million new foreign workers each year?

It is clear that the jobs stimulus cannot even keep up with the monthly influx of foreign workers. Please do all you can do institute a moratorium on all non-essential immigration. The United States does not need more foreign workers. American businesses do not need more foreign workers. America's 15 million unemployed certainly do not need more foreign workers.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. Get the government out of our lives and protect our borders! By the way, the story about you in the November 9, 2009, Globe certainly seems to be on the money from where I stand.
