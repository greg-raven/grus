I demand you veto AB 1840 and protect legally present California home buyers.

First-time home buyers nationwide are bombarded with record-high prices and competition from large corporations. In California, the Dream for All Program was created to give first-time buyers a leg up when they attempt to purchase their homes. However, Assemblyman Arambula's AB 1840 will compromise the goal of the California Dream for All Program by offering taxpayer-funded assistance to people who should not be in our state in the first place.

This disastrous legislation will siphon resources away from citizens and offer them to illegal aliens. Regrettably, California's policies already make our state a magnet for Illegal Aliens, and this legislation would only exacerbate the problem. I demand you VETO this legislation and save California first-time home buyers!

As governor, I request that you lead the California Assembly and Senate in proposing legislation that makes California more affordable for legal residents and stops thinning resources for Americans by handing benefits and taxpayer funds to illegal aliens.
