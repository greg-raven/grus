We are disappointed that Sen. Rand Paul and GOP Chairman Reince Priebus are rushing to amnesty illegal aliens in an effort to reach Hispanic voters. Instead of amnestying illegal aliens and putting millions of Americans out of work, Republicans would be wise to push legislation to bring Hispanic Americans into the middle class. This is the best way of making Hispanic voters into Republican voters.

It's bad enough that 22 million Americans can't find a full-time job, but it's downright horrendous that one in four Hispanic Americans lives in poverty --- that's 2 million more than impoverished black Americans. On top of this, Hispanic American's U6 unemployment rate is 19%.

Any amnesty for illegal aliens would exacerbate these problems and make it much more unlikely for the GOP to get Hispanic votes in the future. If your party really wants to get votes from this portion of the electorate, you need to tighten the labor market and increase wages. You can do this by reducing immigration numbers.

An amnesty for illegal aliens will only make it more difficult, not easier, for the GOP to win future elections. Helping Hispanic voters into the middle class is your party's best path forward.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.
