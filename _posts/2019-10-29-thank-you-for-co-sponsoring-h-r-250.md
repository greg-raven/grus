Thanks for co-sponsoring H.R. 250 to mandate E-Verify!

The Legal Workforce Act would not only require employers to run new hires through the free and easy to use E-Verify system, but it would also notify employers when a suspected stolen or fraudulent Social Security Number has been stolen or is being used. Once this happens, the employers are required to run the employee in question through the E-Verify system to help weed out illegal alien workers.

Simply put, this bill is an easy and cheap way of putting millions of Americans back to work. Thank you for co-sponsoring H.R. 250 to mandate the use of the E-Verify system!
