In 2007 the American people rose up and prevented Congress from passing amnesty. With this in mind, why would you tell members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus that you supported “comprehensive immigration reform?” We both know this is nothing more than a fancy term for amnesty.

There are more than 12 million unemployed Americans. This means that more than 8% of Americans who want a job are unable to find one. I would like to think this statistic breaks your heart, but your continued support for comprehensive amnesty suggests otherwise.

How do you intend on bringing “hope” to the American people if you give our jobs away to illegal aliens? There are currently 7.7 million illegal aliens with jobs. Do you think this is fair? Do you even care about the American families that cannot afford to put food on the table or send their children to college?

I urge you to oppose amnesty of any form (comprehensive or otherwise). Amnesty will harm those you profess a desire to help and only help those who have broken the law. This is not the “hope” I was expecting!

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

P.S. At least twice, you have taken an oath of office to protect the United States from foreign invasion by other illegal aliens. Do your duty!
