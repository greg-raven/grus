Business interests want perpetual growth, but Americans need to face the reality that our country's biodiversity/wildlife habitat and quality-of-life are irreparably damaged as we add millions to our population every year. According to the U.S. Census Bureau, our population is projected to soar to 404 million by the year 2060, with more than 90% due to immigration.

Unfortunately, our leaders are in a constant state of denial. For example, the Democratic Party platform proclaims that Democrats "will protect wildlife habitats and biodiversity ... by conserving 30 percent of our lands and waters by 2030." The Biden administration also has promised that by 2030 greenhouse gas emissions will be reduced to 2005 levels. But both promises are undercut by the Biden administration accepting more than 3 million migrants per year.

Please work to reduce today's unprecedented rates of immigration by limiting chain migration (to immediate family), as well as implementing a nationwide E-Verify system. We must "follow the science" --- infinite population growth is not possible.

Sincerely,

PS: Secure our borders. Stop the influx of immigrants and refugees. Evict those here illegally. End chain migration. End birthright citizenship. End the visa lottery. End amnesty. Make E-Verify mandatory.
