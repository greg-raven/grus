I’m very disturbed by a D.C. court ruling against American tech workers, not least because the "Optional Practical Training" program is a blatant attack on the American middle class. Moreover, the OPT program unfairly disadvantages Americans in competitive STEM fields where Blacks, Hispanics and older workers often struggle to find opportunities.

No less concerning is the court’s rationale that silence from Congress must be interpreted to allow a student visa to become one of our largest work visas.

I ask you: What is the purpose of Congress defining visa categories at all if the President can simply use any silence, real or imagined, to authorize any regulation he sees fit?

End the Optional Practical Training program. End the OPT program.

Sincerely,
