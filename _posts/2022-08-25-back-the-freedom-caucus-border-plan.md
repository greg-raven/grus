It is incredibly disappointing that the White House has taken no steps to address the Biden Border Crisis. The situation at the border represents a threat to our national security, and you and your fellow Republicans need to keep it front and center.

The House Freedom Caucus has released a plan to tackle the crisis. The plan's highlights include:

- mandating the Migrant Protection Protocols;
- strengthening the asylum process to end abuses;
- limiting executive parole of illegal aliens;
- reforming the Flores settlement; and
- ending disparities for UACs.

The Biden Border Crisis will not solve itself. Please help to protect our nation by taking firm steps to implement the Freedom Caucus' plan.

P.S. Secure our borders. Stop all immigration. Stop importing refugees. Remove the illegals who are already in the country. Stop rewarding criminals, foreign or domestic. Wait 40 years before allowing immigrants and refugees again.
