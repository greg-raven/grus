After taking a closer look at your revived immigration proposal, it's nothing more than the plan in 2007 that failed to pass through Congress. I urge you to work towards securing the border, mandating national use of E-Verify, and completion of the entry/exit system before addressing individuals who are illegally in this country.  
  
Your new proposal would drastically increase the number of legal immigrants, and we are still in a time of high unemployment. It also doesn't adequately address the magnets that have led to 11 million illegal aliens living in the United States.

Yes, the proposal does discuss the need for border security and a workplace verification system to ensure jobs don't go to illegal workers, but only after 11 million illegal aliens receive legal status. You may call that a "pathway to citizenship," but I call it an amnesty!

I urge you to stop pushing an unpopular amnesty on the American people and begin supporting real solutions that finally solve the issue of illegal immigration and consider legal immigration numbers that serve in the national interest.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Mr. Greg Raven
