I am a concerned resident of California writing to urge you to OPPOSE AB 2888.

OPPOSE --- Assembly Bill 2888 would expand the list of those eligible to file gun violence restraining orders (GVRO) beyond the currently authorized reporters which include immediate family and law enforcement. The new list is expanded to employers, coworkers, and employees of a secondary or postsecondary school that the person has attended in the last 6 months. GVRO’s can remove a person’s right without due process and not because of a criminal conviction or mental adjudication, but based on third party allegations.

I respectfully ask that you OPPOSE AB 2888.
