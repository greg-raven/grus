I am very disturbed and disappointed with your stance on the current federal enforcement of immigration laws, laws you swore in your oath of office to uphold.

Now, you tell us that American citizens must bend the knee to criminal invaders, on top of paying our money to assist them in their criminal activities.

How about supporting the Trump administration, severing your ties to the Communist Chinese, ditching the High Speed Fail system, and representing legal California citizens instead of driving them from the state?
