Senators and Representative:

The anti-amnesty advertisement running in South Carolina echoes my feelings on Sen. Graham's immigration proposal, which puts the interests of people who have abused our immigration system before the interests of legal immigrants and American citizens. I hope you will instead support fulfilling Congress' broken enforcement promises.  
  
For years, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina has tried to be a champion for amnesty. But giving an amnesty to 11 million illegal aliens along with work permits won't help our country's unemployment problem; it will only hurt it even more.

Also, the Affordable Health Care Act requires all legal residents to qualify for government health care. Since most illegal aliens are low-skilled workers who will be working low-paying jobs, they will be more likely to qualify for taxpayer-subsidized health insurance. They'll also immediately qualify for Social Security, Medicare, the Earned Income Tax Credit, and child tax credits. The Heritage Foundation says this amnesty will result in the single greatest increase in entitlement spending in history.

The costs of an amnesty are simply too much for Americans to bear. Please oppose amnesty or any other position that rewards illegal immigration.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Mr. Greg Raven
