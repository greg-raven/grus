H.R. 319, in addition to requiring employers to run new hires through the Chamber of Commerce-approved E-Verify system, would move illegal aliens out of U.S. jobs. Over time, the more than 7 million illegal aliens in non-agricultural jobs would be replaced by unemployed Americans and legal immigrants. While not solving America's unemployment or illegal immigration problems, the Legal Workforce Act would certainly lessen their severity.

This legislation is able to coax out these illegal workers by telling employers if the name and Social Security number of a current employee do not match. Clearly, this is an easy and effective way of putting unemployed Americans and legal immigrants in jobs currently held by illegal aliens.

Please support, H.R. 319, the Legal Workforce Act and help Americans get back to work and help employers stay on the right side of the law.
