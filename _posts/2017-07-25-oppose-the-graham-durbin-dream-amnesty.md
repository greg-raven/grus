I, along with the vast majority of your constituents, oppose the DREAM Act amnesty. Please oppose this legislation offered by Senators Lindsey Graham and Dick Durbin.

The DREAM Act would give out millions of additional work permits at a time when Millennials are struggling to find work.

Any current or future illegal alien who enters the U.S. before the age of 17 and maintains continuous presence in the U.S. for at least 4, with exceptions, can receive the amnesty

Once they meet criteria, the illegal aliens are given "conditional lawful permanent resident status" and are given an 8-year work permit to compete directly with the millions of Americans who want a full-time job but can't find one.

Estimates suggest that up to 2 million illegal aliens could legitimately qualify for the opening application, and since the amnesty is open-ended with no numerical limitation, millions more could qualify.

Those millions would immediately be able to legally compete for any U.S. job.

The DREAM amnesty allows those who fail to meet any of the criteria after 8 years to file a claim of hardship. DHS is given the authority to issue waivers and allow these illegal aliens to stay.

Why, at this time of high unemployment for Millennials, is Congress considering an amnesty to increase the job competition for unemployed Americans?

Phone me if you would like to talk about this.

P.S. How about we stop all immigration until we figure out who is already here, and remove the ones who shouldn't be?
