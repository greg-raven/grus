I am glad you voted in favor of H.R. 5272. Please continue to do all you can to stop President Obama's pro-illegal alien policies.

President Obama continues to ignore and flout America's immigration laws. This has encouraged tens of thousands of illegal aliens to come to the U.S. illegally in expectation of amnesty. The president's DACA program has contributed to this problem.

Thank you for working to solve our nation's illegal immigration problem.

Phone me if you would like to talk about this,

Greg Raven
