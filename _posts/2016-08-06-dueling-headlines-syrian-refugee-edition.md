**Obama Is Set To Deliver On One Promise For Syrian Refugees**

*President Barack Obama set a goal of admitting at least 10,000 Syrian refugees in the 2016 fiscal year.*

WASHINGTON ― The United States is on track to admit President Barack Obama's goal of 10,000 Syrian refugees by the end of the 2016 fiscal year, in spite of resistance from Republican politicians and virulent anti-refugee fearmongering from GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump.

About 8,000 Syrian refugees have been resettled in the U.S. since last October ― more than three-quarters of them women and children ― and the administration expects to admit at least 2,000 more by the end of September, when the 2016 fiscal year ends, officials announced on Friday.

**Obama administration to go beyond 10,000 Syrian refugees**

*80 percent approved, 7 percent denied*

Administration officials said Friday that the 10,000 Syrian refugees President Obama wants to welcome this fiscal year is a floor, not a ceiling, and they can go even higher than that total.

"We can now say that we've welcomed 8,000 Syrian refugees so far this year and we are very confident we will welcome at least 10,000," Assistant Secretary of State Anne C. Richard told reporters in updating the flow.

At today's pace, more than 12,000 refugees could be admitted by the end of September, which marks the end of the fiscal year.

**Syrian Prof: Arabs Migrate for 'Sluts' and Welfare, Attack When They Don't Get It**

A Syrian professor has asserted that Arab migrants see "slut" German women as fair game for assault and warned that the country is set to see "big social conflicts" as a result of Angela Merkel and EU open border policies.

Prof. Bassam Tibi said that the mass sex attacks in Cologne were a result of the migrants' "value system": furious at not being given a luxury lifestyle, they intended to "humiliate" Germans.

The professor, who now lives in Germany, said that Arab men come expecting "great apartments, blonde women, and the welfare state."
