I urge you to co-sponsor H.R. 891, the Nuclear Family Priority Act!

Chain migration was recklessly put into our immigration system 50 years ago. At first glance, it seems relatively harmless as it allows immigrants to bring in not only their spouse and minor children but also their brothers, sisters, and adult children. But that starts a chain that cannot be stopped. Each of those adult relatives can bring in his/her spouse, leading to the mother-in-law, father-in-law, brother-in-law, and sister-in-law. All of that leads to the immigration of the original immigrant's cousins, aunts, uncles and the in-laws of the in-laws of the in-laws.

The result of all this uncontrolled migration is that our nation is undergoing its biggest population explosion ever, leading to massive loss of natural habitat and farmland, flooding American occupations with excess labor that increases unemployment and depresses wages, and increasing taxpayer spending on welfare and entitlement programs.

You can help to solve this problem by co-sponsoring H.R. 891, the Nuclear Family Priority Act. I hope you will do so today.
