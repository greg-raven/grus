Immigration, unemployment, and housing costs are all too high.

The 240,000 initial unemployment claims filed in February were the most since October. Several big corporations announced staff-reduction plans, including Starbucks, Meta, and Southwest Airlines, putting working-class and middle-class jobs at risk. There is no labor shortage.

I am hopeful that you will reduce immigration.

Ninety percent of net job growth since 2020 have gone to immigrants. More than half of the jobs that went to immigrants went to illegal workers. Why are we issuing a million green cards every year? Mass immigration is a contributing factor to the rising cost of housing. Every generation feels less confident in owning their own home than the last.

Rising housing costs and declining economic opportunities are inevitable downsides of running immigration at unsustainably high levels. We just had an election about this. We need an overall reduction in immigration to something that's more fair and sustainable.
